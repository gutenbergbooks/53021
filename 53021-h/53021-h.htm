<h2 id="PREFACE">PREFACE</h2>

<p>The history of Frey T&oacute;mas de Torquemada is the
history of the establishment of the Modern Inquisition.
It is not so much the history of a man as of an abstract
genius presiding over a gigantic and cruel engine of
its own perfecting. Of this engine we may examine
for ourselves to-day the details of the complex
machinery. Through the records that survive we
may observe its cold, smooth action, and trace in
this the awful intelligence of its architect. But of
that architect himself we are permitted to catch no
more than an occasional and fleeting glimpse. It is
only in the rarest and briefest moments that he stands
clearly before us, revealed as a man of flesh and
blood.</p>

<p>We see him, now fervidly urging a reluctant queen
to do her duty by her God and unsheathe the sword
of persecution, now harshly threatening his sovereigns
with the wrath of Heaven when they are in danger
of relenting in the wielding of that same sword. But
in the main he must be studied, not in his actions,
but in his enactments&mdash;the emanations of his relentless
spirit. In these he is to be seen devoutly compassing
evil in the perfervid quest of good.</p>

<p>Untouched by worldly ambitions, he seems at
once superhuman and less than human. Dauntless
amid execrations, unmoved by plaudits, sublimely disdainful
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
of temporal weal, in nothing is he so admirable
as in the unfaltering self-abnegation with which he
devotes himself to the service of his God, in nothing
so terrible and tragically deplorable as in the actual
service which he renders.</p>

<p>“His history,” says Prescott, “may be thought to
prove that of all human infirmities there is none
productive of more extensive mischief to society than
fanaticism.”</p>

<p>To this day&mdash;four centuries after his passing&mdash;Spain
still bears the imprint of his pitiless work,
and none may deny the truth of Rosseeuw St. Hilaire’s
indictment that, after Philip II, Torquemada was the
man who did most harm to the land that gave him
birth.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The materials for this history have been gathered
from the sources cited in the appended bibliography,
to all of which the author acknowledges his profound
indebtedness. In particular, however, are his thanks
due&mdash;as must be the thanks of all men who engage in
studies of the Spanish Inquisition&mdash;to the voluminous,
succinct, and enormously comprehensive works of
Juan Antonio Llorente, a historian of unimpugned
honesty and authority, who wrote under circumstances
peculiarly advantageous and with qualifications peculiarly
full.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Juan Antonio Llorente was born at Logro&ntilde;o in
1756, and he was ordained priest in 1779, after a
university course of Roman and Canon law which
enabled him to obtain a place among the lawyers
of the Supreme Council of Castile&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> the Council
of the Inquisition. Having graduated as a Doctor of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
Canon Law, he discharged the duties of Vicar-General
to the Bishop of Calahorra, and later on became the
Commissary of the Holy Office in Logro&ntilde;o&mdash;for which
it was necessary that he should prove that he was of
“clean blood,” undefiled by the taint of Jew or Moor
or heretic.</p>

<p>In 1789 he was appointed Secretary-General to
the Holy Office, an appointment which took him to
Madrid, where he was well received by the King, who
gave him a canonry of Calahorra.</p>

<p>A profound student of sociological questions, with
leanings towards rationalism, he provoked a certain
degree of mistrust, and when the Liberal party fell
from power and dragged with it many of those who
had held offices of consequence, the young priest
found himself not only deposed, but forced to meet
certain minor charges, which resulted in his being sent
into retreat in a convent for a month as a penance.</p>

<p>Thereafter he concerned himself with educational
matters until the coming of Bonaparte’s eagles into
Spain. When that invasion took place, he hailed the
French as the saviours of his country, and as a consequence
found himself a member of the Assembly of
Notables convoked by Murat to reform the Spanish
Government. But most important of all, from our
point of view, is the fact that when the Inquisition
was abolished, in 1809, he accepted the charge of
going through its vast archives, and he spent two
years and employed a number of amanuenses in
copying or making extracts of all that he considered
of account.</p>

<p>He held various offices of importance under the
French Government, so that when this was finally
expelled from Spain, he, too, was forced to go. He
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
sought refuge in Paris, and there he wrote his famous
“Historia Critica de la Inquisicion de Espa&ntilde;a,” the
crystallization of his vast researches.</p>

<p>It was a very daring thing to have done, and,
thanks to the royalist and clerical Government, he was
not suffered to remain long unpunished. He was inhibited
from hearing confession or celebrating Mass&mdash;practically
unfrocked&mdash;and forbidden to teach the
Castilian language in private schools. He hit back
by publishing “The Political Portrait of the Popes,”
which earned him orders to leave France immediately.
He set out in December of 1822 to return to Spain,
and died a few days after reaching Madrid, killed by
the rigours of the journey at his advanced age.</p>

<p>Although his “Critical History” displays at times
a certain vehemence, in the main it is concerned with
the sober transcription of the musty records he was
privileged to explore.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Spanish Inquisition has been the subject of
much unrestrained and exaggerated writing, expressing
points of view that are diametrically opposed.
From such authors as Garcia Rodrigo, who laud its
work of purification, misrepresent its scope, and deplore
(in our own times) the extinction of that terrible
tribunal, it is a far cry indeed to such writers as
Dr. Rule, who dip their pens in the gall of an intolerance
as virulent as that which they attack.</p>

<p>The author has sought here to hold a course that
is unencumbered by religious partisanship, treating
purely as a phase of history the institution for which
Torquemada was so largely responsible. He has not
written in the Catholic interest, or the Protestant
interest, or the Jewish interest. He holds the view
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
that on the score of intolerance it is not for Christians
to cast a stone at Jews, nor Jews at Christians, nor
yet Christians of one sect at Christians of another.
Each will find in his own history more than enough
to answer for at the bar of Humanity. And when
achievement is measured by opportunity, each will
discover that he is entitled to fling at the others no
reproaches which the others are not entitled to fling
at him.</p>

<p>If the Spanish Inquisition is here shown as a
ruthless engine of destruction whose wheels drip the
blood of mangled generations, yet it is very far from
being implied that religious persecution is an offence
peculiar to the Church of Rome.</p>

<p>“She persecuted to the full extent of the power
of her clergy, and that power was very great. The
persecution of which every Protestant church was
guilty was measured by the same rule, but clerical
influence in Protestant countries was comparatively
weak.”</p>

<p>Thus Lecky, whom we quote lest any should be
tempted to use anything in these pages as a weapon
of unchristian Christian partisanship. Let any such
remember that against Torquemada, who was unfortunately
well served by opportunity, may be set the
bloody-minded John Knox, who, fortunately for
humanity, was not; let him ponder the slaughter of
Presbyterians, Puritans, and Roman Catholics under
Elizabeth; let him call to mind the persecutions of
the Anabaptists under Edward VI, and the Anabaptists’
own clamour for the blood of all who were
not re-baptized.

<span class="medium">EARLY PERSECUTIONS</span></h2>

<p>In an endeavour to trace the Inquisition to its source
it is not necessary to go as far back into antiquity
as went Paramo; nor yet is it possible to agree with
him that God Himself was the first inquisitor, that
the first “Act of Faith” was executed upon Adam
and Eve, and that their expulsion from Eden is a
proper precedent for the confiscation of the property
of heretics.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a></p>

<p>Nevertheless, it is necessary to go very far back
indeed; for it is in the very dawn of Christianity
that the beginnings of this organization are to be
discovered.</p>

<p>There is no more lamentable lesson to be culled
from history than that contained in her inability to
furnish a single instance of a religion accepted with
unquestioning sincerity and fervour which did not,
out of those very qualities, beget intolerance. It
would seem that only when a faith has been diluted
by certain general elements of doubt, that only when
a certain degree of indifference has crept into the
observance of a prevailing cult, does it become possible
for the members of that cult to bear themselves
complacently towards the members of another. Until
this comes to pass, intolerance is the very breath of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
religion, and&mdash;when the power is present&mdash;this intolerance
never fails to express itself in persecution.</p>

<p>Deplorable as this is in all religions, in none is it so
utterly anomalous as in Christianity, which is established
upon tenets of charity, patience, and forbearance, and
which has for cardinal guidance its Founder’s sublime
admonition&mdash;“Love one another!”</p>

<p>From the earliest days of its history, persecution
has unfailingly signalized the spread of Christianity,
until to the thoughtful observer Christianity must
afford the grimmest, the saddest&mdash;indeed, the most
tragic&mdash;of all the paradoxes that go to make up the
history of civilized man.</p>

<p>Its benign gospel of love has been thundered forth
in malign hatred; its divine lesson of patience and
forbearance has been taught in murderous impatience
and bloodthirsty intolerance; its mild tenets of mercy
and compassion have been ferociously expounded with
fire and sword and rack; its precepts of humility have
been inculcated with a pride and arrogance as harsh
as any that the world has known.</p>

<p>It is impossible to deny that at almost any time in
the history of Christianity the enlightened pagan of
the second century would have been justified of his
stinging gibe&mdash;“Behold how these Christians love
one another!”</p>

<p>It may even be said of the earliest Christians that
it was largely through their own intolerance of the
opinions and beliefs of others that they brought upon
themselves the persecutions to which through three
centuries they were intermittently subjected. Certain
it is that they were the first to disturb the toleration
which in polytheistic Rome was accorded to all religions.
They might have pursued their cult unmolested
so long as they accorded the same liberty to others.
But by the vehemence with which they denounced
false all creeds but their own, they offended the
zealous worshippers of other gods, and so disturbed
the peace of the community; by denying obedience
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
to the state in which they dwelt, by refusing to bear
arms for the Empire on the plea of “Nolo militare;
militia mea est ad Dominum!” they provoked the
resentment of the law. When driven, by the beginnings
of persecution, to assemble and celebrate their
rites in secret, this very secrecy became the cause
of further and sharper proceedings against them.
Their mysteriousness evoked suspicion, and surmise
sprang up to explain it. Very soon there was levelled
against them the charge from which hardly any cult
that celebrates in secret has been exempt. It was
put abroad that they practised abominations, and that
they engaged in the ritual murder of infants. Public
opinion, ever credulous where evil is the subject, was
still further inflamed against them, and fresh and
greater disorders were the result. Thus they came
to be denounced for atheism, insubordination, and
subversion of public order.</p>

<p>The severity dealt out to them by a state hitherto
indifferent&mdash;through the agnosticism prevalent in the
ruling classes&mdash;to the religious opinions of its citizens,
was dictated by the desire to suppress an element that
had become socially perturbative, rather than by any
vindictiveness or intolerance towards this new cult out
of Syria.</p>

<p>Under Claudius we see the Nazarenes expelled
from Rome as disturbers of the public peace; under
Nero and Domitian we see them, denounced as <i>hostes
publici</i>, suffering their first great persecution. But
that persecution on purely religious grounds was
repugnant to the Roman is shown by the conduct of
Nerva, who forbade delations and oppressions on the
score of belief, and recalled the Christians who had
been banished. His successor, the just and wise
Trajan, provoked perhaps by the fierce insurrection of
the Jews which occurred in his reign, moved against
the Nazarenes at first, but later on afforded them
complete toleration. Similarly were they unmolested
by the accomplished Adrian, who, indeed, so far
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
approved of their creed as to have notions of including
Christ in the Roman Pantheon; and they were left in
peace by his successor Antoninus, notwithstanding
that the last was so attached to the faith of his
country and to the service of the gods as to have
earned for himself the surname of Pius.</p>

<p>With the accession of the philosopher-emperor
Marcus Aurelius, who was rendered hostile to the new
doctrine not only by his own stoical convictions, but
also because politically he viewed the Christians with
disfavour, came the next great persecution; and persecution
was their portion thereafter for some sixty
years, under four reigns, until the accession of
Alexander Severus in the third decade of the third
century of the Christian era.</p>

<p>Alexander’s mother, Julia Mannea, is believed to
have been instructed in the new doctrine by
Origen, the Alexandrian, although her conversion to
Christianity and her ideas upon it do not appear to
be greatly in advance of those of Adrian, for she is said
to have included an image of Christ in the group of
beneficent deities set up in her <i>lararium</i>.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span></p>

<p>For twenty years the Christians now knew peace
and enjoyed the fullest liberty. Upon that followed
a period of severe oppression, initiated by Decius,
continued by Valerian and Aurelian, and reaching
something of a climax under Diocletian, in the dawn
of the fourth century, when the Christians endured the
cruellest and most ferocious of all these persecutions.
But the end of their sufferings was at hand, and with
the accession of Constantine in 312 a new era began
for Christianity. Constantine, upheld by the Christians
as their saviour, in admitting the inevitable predominance
which the new religion had obtained in rather
less than three hundred years, was compelled to
recognize the rights of its votaries not only to existence
but to authority.</p>

<p>Legends surround the history of this emperor. The
most popular relates how, when he was marching
against Maxentius, his rival for the throne, desponding
in the consciousness of his own inferior force,
there appeared at sunset a fiery cross in the heavens
with the inscription ΕΝ ΤΟΓΤΩ ΝΙΚΑ&mdash;<small>IN THIS SIGN
YOU CONQUER</small>. And it is claimed that as a consequence
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
of this portent, whose injunction he obeyed, he sought
instruction in Christianity, was baptized and made
public avowal of that faith. Others maintain that he
was reared in Christianity by his mother, St. Helena&mdash;she
who made an expedition to the Holy Land to
recover the true cross, and who is said to have
built the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem;
whilst others still assert that Constantine did not
receive baptism until at the point of death, and that
throughout his life, whilst undoubtedly favouring
Christians, he continued in the pagan religion in
which he had been educated by his father.</p>

<p>The truth probably lies midway. During the
early years of his reign Constantine not only pursued
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
a middle course, according religious liberty to all sects,
but, himself, whilst leaning strongly towards Christianity,
retained his imperial dignity of High-priest of
the polytheistic Roman cult, and the title “Pontifex
Maximus,” which later&mdash;together with so much else of
pagan origin&mdash;was appropriated by the Christians and
bestowed upon their chief bishop. But in 313-14
he refused to celebrate the <i>ludi seculares</i>, and in 330
he issued an edict forbidding temple-worship, whilst
the Christian Council of Nic&aelig;a, in 325, was held
undoubtedly under his auspices.</p>

<p>From the very moment that the new religion found
itself recognized and invested not only with civil rights
but actually with power, from the very moment that
the Christian could rear his head and go openly and
unafraid abroad, from that very moment do we find
him engaging in persecutions against the votaries
of other cults&mdash;against pagan, Jew, and heretic. For
although Christianity was but in the beginning of
the fourth century of its existence, not only had
it spread irresistibly and mightily in spite of the
repressive measures against it, but it was already
beginning to know dismemberment and divisions in
its own body. Indeed, it has been computed that the
number of schisms in the fourth century amounted to
no less than ninety.</p>

<p>Of these the most famous is that of Arius, a
priest of Alexandria, who denied that Christ was God
Incarnate, accounting Him no more than divinely
inspired, the first and the highest of the sons of
men. Although already denounced by the Synod that
met at Alexandria in 321, so great had been the
spread of this doctrine that the Œcumenical Council
of Nic&aelig;a was convoked especially to deal with it.
It was then condemned as heretical, and the Articles
of Faith were defined and set down in the Nicene
Creed, which is recited to this day.</p>

<p>Other famous heresies were the Manich&aelig;an, the
Gnostic, the Adamite, the Severist, and the Donatist;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
and to these were soon to be added, amongst others,
the Pelagian and the Priscilliantist.</p>

<p>Perhaps the Manich&aelig;ans’ chief claim to celebrity
lies in the fact that the great St. Augustine of
Tagaste, when he abandoned the disorders of his
youth, entered Christianity through this sect, which
professed a form of it vitiated by Sun-worship and
Buddhism.</p>

<p>The other heresies&mdash;with the exception of the
Pelagian&mdash;were, in the main, equally fantastic. The
Gnostic heresy, with its many subdivisions, was made
up of mysticism and magic, and founded upon Zoroastrian
notions of dualism, of the two powers of good
and evil, light and darkness. To the power of evil it
attributed all creation save man, whose soul was accounted
of divine substance. The Adamites claimed to
be in the state of original innocency of Adam before
the fall; they demanded purity in their followers, rejected
marriage, which they urged could never have
come into existence but for sin, and they expelled from
their Church all sinners against their tenets, even as
Adam and Eve had been expelled from Eden. The
Severists denied the resurrection of the flesh, would
not accept the acts of the apostles, and carried purity
to fantastic lengths. The Soldiers of Florinus denied
the Last Judgment, and held it as an undeniable truth
that the resurrection of the flesh lay entirely in reproduction.</p>

<p>The Pelagians were the followers of Pelagius, a
British monk who settled in Rome towards the year
400, and his heresy at least was founded upon rational
grounds. He denied the doctrine of original sin,
maintained that every human being was born in a
state of innocency, and that his perseverance in virtue
depended upon himself. He found numerous followers,
and for twenty years the conflict raged between
Pelagians and the Church, until Pope Zosimus declared
against them and banished Pelagius from Rome.</p>

<p>From Constantine onwards Christianity steadily
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
maintains her ascendancy, and her earliest assertion
of her power is to bare the sword of persecution,
oblivious of the lofty protests against it which she,
herself, had uttered, the broad and noble advocacy
of tolerance which she had urged in the days of her
own affliction. We find Optatus urging the massacre
of the Donatists&mdash;who claimed that theirs was the
true Church&mdash;and Constantine threatening with the
stake any Jew who should affront a Christian and
any Christian who should become a Jew. We find
him demolishing the churches of the Arians and
Donatists, banishing their priests and forbidding under
pain of death the propagation of their doctrines.</p>

<p>The power of Christianity suffered one slight
check thereafter, under the tolerant rule of Julian
the Apostate, who reopened the pagan temples and
restored the cult of the old gods; but it rose again to
be finally and firmly established under Theodosius
in 380.</p>

<p>Now we see the pagan temples not only closed,
but razed to the ground, the images broken and swept
away, their worship, and even private sacrifice, forbidden
under pain of death. From Libanius we may
gather something of the desolation which this spread
among the pagan peasant-folk. Residing at a distance
from the great centres where doctrines were being
expounded, they found themselves bereft of the old
gods and without knowledge of the new. Their plight
is a far more pathetic one than that of the Arians,
Manich&aelig;ans, Donatists, and all other heretics against
whom there was a similar enactment.</p>

<p>It is now, at this early date, that for the first
time we come across the title “Inquisitor of the Faith,”
in the first law<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> promulgated to render death the
penalty of heresy. It is now that we find the great
Augustine of Tagaste&mdash;the mightiest genius that the
Church has brought forth&mdash;denouncing religious
liberty with the question, “Quid est enim pejor, mors
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
anim&aelig; quam libertas erroris?”<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> and strenuously urging
the death of heretics on the ground that it is a
merciful measure, since it must result in the saving
of others from the damnation consequent upon their
being led into error. Similarly he applauded those
decrees of death against any one pursuing the polytheism
that but a few generations earlier had been the
official religion of the Roman Empire.</p>

<p>It was Augustine&mdash;of whom it has been truly said
that “no man since the days of the Apostles has
infused into the Church a larger measure of his
spirit”&mdash;in his enormous fervour, and with the overwhelming
arguments inspired by his stupendous intellect,
who laid down the principles that governed
persecution, and were cited in justification of it for
nearly 1,500 years after his day. “He was,” says
Lecky, “the most staunch and enthusiastic defender
of all those doctrines that grow out of the habits of
mind that lead to persecution.”<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a></p>

<p>So far, however much persecution may have been
inspired by the Church, its actual execution had rested
entirely and solely with the civil authorities; and this
aloofness, indeed, is urged upon the clergy by St.
Augustine. But already before the close of the
fourth century we find ecclesiastics themselves directly
engaged in causing the death of heretics.</p>

<p>Priscillian, a Spanish theologian, was led by St.
Paul’s “Know ye not that ye are the temple of God?” to
seek to render himself by purity a worthy dwelling. He
preached from that text a doctrine of stern asceticism,
and forbade the marriage of the clergy. This at the
time was optional,<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> and by proclaiming it to be Christ’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
law he laid himself open to a charge of heresy. He
was accused of magic and licentiousness, excommunicated
in 380 and burnt alive, together with several of
his companions, by order of two Christian bishops.
He has been described as the first martyr burnt by a
Spanish Inquisition.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a></p>

<p>It must be added that the deed excited the profoundest
indignation on the part of the clergy against
those bishops who had been responsible for it, and
St. Martin of Tours hotly denounced the act. But
this indignation was not provoked by the fact that
men had suffered death for heresy, but by the circumstance
that ecclesiastics had procured the execution.
For it was part of the pure teaching of the early
Church that under no circumstances&mdash;not as judge,
soldier, or executioner&mdash;should a Christian render
himself the instrument of the death of a fellow-creature;
and it was partly through their rigid
obedience to this precept that the Christians had first
drawn attention to themselves and aroused the resentment
of the Roman government, as we have seen.
Now, whilst at no time after the Church’s accession to
power was this teaching observed with any degree of
strictness, yet there were limits to the extent to which
it might be neglected, and that limit, it was considered,
had been exceeded by those prelates responsible for
the death of the Priscilliantists.</p>

<p>The point, apparently trivial at present, has been
insisted upon here, in view of the important and
curious part which it was destined to play in the procedure
of the Inquisition.</p>

<p>The Church had now come to identify herself with
the State. She had strengthened her organizations;
she had permeated the State with her influences, until
it may almost be said that the State had lost its
capacity for independent existence, and had become
her instrument. The civil laws were based upon her
spiritual laws; the standard of morality was founded
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
upon her doctrines; the development of the arts&mdash;of
painting, sculpture, literature, and music&mdash;became
such as was best adapted for her service, and, cramped
thereby into confines far too narrow, was partly
arrested for a time; sciences and crafts were stimulated
only by her needs and curbed by her principles;
the very recreation of the people was governed by her
spirit.</p>

<p>And yet, whilst influencing the State in its every
ramification so profoundly that State and Church
appeared welded into one disintegrable whole, she
kept herself independent, unfettered, and autonomous.
So that when that great Empire of the West upon
which she had seemed to lean was laid in ruins by the
invading barbarians, she continued upright, unshaken
by that tremendous cataclysm. She remained to
conquer the barbarian far more subtly and completely
than he had conquered. Her conquest lay in bringing
him to look upon her as the natural inheritor of fallen
Rome. Soon she entered upon that splendid heritage,
claiming for her own the world-supremacy that Rome
had boasted, and assuming dominion over the new
nations that were building upon the ruins of the
shattered empire.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II<br />

<span class="medium">THE INQUISITION CANONICALLY ESTABLISHED</span></h2>

<p>For some seven centuries after the fall of the Roman
Empire persecutions for heresy were very rare and
very slight. This, however, cannot be attributed to
mercy. Although some of the old heresies survived,
yet they were so sapped of their vitality that they were
no longer openly flaunted in defiance of the mother-Church,
but were practised in such obscurity as, in the
main, to escape observation.</p>

<p>Fresh schisms, on the other hand, do not appear
to have sprung up during that spell. Largely this
would be due to the clear formulation of the Catholic
theology by the various œcumenical councils held in
the years that followed upon the Christian emancipation,
and by the intellectual breadth of these doctrines,
which were entirely adequate and all-sufficient to the
intellectual capacity of the time. But this state of
things could only have endured at the cost of arresting
man’s intellectual progress. A certain restraint and
curb undoubtedly was exerted, but definitely to check
the imaginative and reasoning faculties of man has
never been within the power of any creed, and never
can be. It was in vain that the Church sought to
coerce thought and to stifle the learning that struck at
her very foundations and discovered the error of the
cosmic and historical conceptions upon which her
theology was based; in vain that she entrenched
herself within her doctrines, and adhered rigidly to the
form she had adopted.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span></p>

<p>Upon this uncompromising rigidity of the Catholic
Church much censure has been poured. The present
aim is a cold survey of certain features of history, and
in such a task all polemical matters should be avoided.
Yet it may be permissible to say a word here to
elucidate rather than to defend an attitude that has
been unduly abused.</p>

<p>It is admitted that the unyielding policy of the
Church was one that militated seriously against intellectual
evolution, and on that account it is to be
deplored. But let the unbiassed mind consider for a
moment the alternative. The admission of error is
the commencement of disruption. Where one error
is admitted, a thread is drawn from a weft whose
threads are interdependent for the stability of the
whole. Who has yielded once has set up a precedent
that will be urged against him to make him
yield again, and yet again, until he shall have yielded
all, and, having nothing left, must suffer an imperceptible
effacement.</p>

<p>When all is considered, there is an indisputable
dignity in the attitude of a Church which, claiming
that what she teaches rests not upon human knowledge
but upon divine inspiration, refuses to cede one jot
of her doctrines to man’s discoveries; holding&mdash;and
incontestably, so long as the premise is admitted&mdash;that
however certain may appear the truths which
human subtlety has disclosed, however false may
appear the doctrines to which she owes her being, it
still remains that the former are human and the latter
divine of origin. Between the two she proudly holds
that there is no disputing; that error possible to man
is impossible to divinity; that man’s perception of
error in the divine tenets of the Church is no more
than the manifestation of his own liability to err.</p>

<p>The Church of Rome realized that either she must
be entirely, or entirely cease to be. And it is matter
for unprejudiced consideration whether the spectacle
of her immobility is not more dignified than would
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
have been that of her yielding up her divinities one by
one to the expanding humanities, and thus gradually
undergoing a course of dismemberment which must in
the end remove her last claim to existence. In the
attitude she assumed she remained the absolute mistress
of her votaries; had she departed from it she must
have become their abject servant.</p>

<p>Dr. Rule invites his readers to notice attentively
that “no Church but that of Rome ever had an
Inquisition.”<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> But he neglects to carry the consideration
to its logical conclusion, and to add that in
no Christian Church but that of Rome could an
Inquisition be possible. For it would be impossible
to offend heretically against any Church that accommodates
itself to new habits of thought in a measure
as these occur, and gives way step by step before the
onslaught of learning.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a></p>

<p>The Church of Rome presented her immutable
formularies, her unchangeable doctrines to the world.
“This,” she announced, “is my teaching. By this I
hold. This you must accept without reservations, in
its entirety, or you are no child of mine.”</p>

<p>With that there could be no cavil. Had she but
added the admission of man’s liberty to accept or reject
her teaching, had she but left man free to confess or
not her doctrines as his conscience and intelligence
directed, all would have been well. Unfortunately
she accounted it her duty to go further; she used
coercion and compulsion to such an extent that she
imbued her children with the spirit of the eighteenth-century
Jacobin, exclaiming, “Be my brother, or I kill you!”</p>

<p>Unable by intellectual means to stem the intellectual
secession from her ranks, she had recourse to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
physical measures, and revived the fiercely coercive
methods of the first centuries.</p>

<p>A serious heretical outbreak had been occurring
in Southern France. There, it would seem, all the
schisms that had disturbed the Church since her
foundation were gathered together&mdash;Arians, Manich&aelig;ans,
and Gnostics&mdash;to which were added certain
more recent sects, such as the Cathars, the Waldenses,
and the Boni Homines, or Good People.</p>

<p>These new-comers deserve a word of explanation.</p>

<p>The Cathars, like the Gnostics, were dualists;
indeed, their creed was little more than a development
of Gnosticism. They believed that the earth was the
only hell or purgatory, that it was given over to the
power of the devil, and that human bodies were no
more than the prisons of the angel spirits that fell with
Lucifer. In heaven their celestial bodies still awaited
them, but they could not resume these until they had
worked out their expiation. To accomplish this a man
must die reconciled with God; failing that, another
earthly existence awaited him in the body of man or
beast, according to his deserts. It will be seen that,
saving for abundant Christian elements introduced
into this faith, it was little more than a revival of
metempsychosis, the oldest and most fascinating of
intelligent beliefs.</p>

<p>The Waldenses, or Vaudois, with whom were
allied the Good People, were the earliest Protestants,
as we understand the term. They claimed for every
man the right to interpret the Bible and to celebrate
the sacraments of the Church without the need of
being in holy orders. Further, they denied that the
Roman Church was the Church of Christ.</p>

<p>These sects were known collectively as the
Albigenses, so called because the Council of Lombers,
convoked to pronounce their condemnation, had been
held in the Diocese of Albi in 1165.</p>

From the Painting by Berruguete.</p>
</div>

<p>Pope Innocent III made an attempt to convert
them; with this aim in view he sent two monks, Peter
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
de Castelnau and one Rodolfe, to restore order amongst
them and induce them to return to submission. But
when they murdered one of his legates the Holy
Father had recourse to those other less legitimate
measures of combating liberty of conscience. He
ordered the King of France, the nobles and clergy
of the kingdom, to assume the crusader’s cross, and
to proceed to the extirpation of the Albigensian
heretics, whom he described as a worse danger to
Christendom than the Saracens; and he armed them
for the fray with the same spiritual weapons that
John VIII had bestowed upon those who went to
war in Palestine in the ninth century. Upon all who
might die in the service of the Church he pronounced
a plenary indulgence.</p>

<p>It is not the present aim to follow the history of
the horrible strife that ensued&mdash;the massacres, pillages,
burnings that took place in the course of the war
between the Albigenses under Raymond of Toulouse
and the Crusaders under Simon de Montfort. For
over twenty years did that war drag on, and in the
course of it the original grounds of the quarrel were
forgotten; it passed into a struggle for supremacy
between North and South, and thus, properly speaking,
out of the history of the Inquisition.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a></p>

<p>Now, for all that the title “Inquisitor of the Faith”
was first bestowed by the Theodosian Code, and for
all that persecutions against heretics and others had
been afoot since an even earlier date than that of
Theodosius, Innocent III is to be considered the
founder of the Holy Inquisition as an integral part
of the Church. For it is under his jurisdiction that
the faculty of persecuting heretics, which hitherto had
belonged entirely to the secular arm, is now conferred
upon the clergy. He dispatched two Cistercian
monks as inquisitors into France and Spain, to engage
in the work of extirpating heretics; and he strictly
enjoined all princes, nobles and prelates to afford every
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
assistance to these emissaries, and to further them
in every way in the work they were sent to do.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a></p>

<p>Himself, personally, Pope Innocent directed his
attention to the Paterini&mdash;a sect which rebelled against
the celibacy imposed upon the clergy&mdash;who were gaining
ground in Italy. He invoked the secular arm to
assist him in their apprehension, imprisonment, and
banishment, in seizing their possessions, which were
confiscated, and in razing their houses to the ground.</p>

<p>In 1209 he assembled a council at Avignon, under
the presidency of his legates, wherein by his directions
it was ordained that every bishop should select such of
his subjects, counts, castellans, and knights as might
seem to him proper, and swear them to undertake
the extermination of all excommunicated heretics.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“And to the end that the bishop may be the
better enabled to purge his diocese of heretical
pravity, let him swear one priest and two, three or
more laymen of good repute in every parish to report
to the bishop himself, and to the governors of cities
or to the lords and bailiffs of places, the existence
of any heretics or abettors of heresy wherever found,
to the end that these may be punished according to
the canonical and legal dispensations, in all cases
suffering forfeiture of property. And should the said
governors and others be negligent or reluctant in the
execution of this divine service, let their persons
be severally excommunicated, and their territories
placed under the interdict of the Church.”<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the year 1215 Pope Innocent held a further
council at the Lateran in which he extended the field
of ecclesiastical activity in persecution. He issued an
injunction to all rulers, “as they desired to be esteemed
faithful, to swear a public oath that they would labour
zealously to exterminate from their dominions all those
who were denounced as heretics by the Church.”<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span></p>

<p>This injunction was backed by a bull which
menaced with excommunication and forfeiture of
jurisdiction any prince who should fail to extirpate
heretics from his dominions&mdash;so that at one stroke
the Pope asserted his power to an extent that denied
liberty of conscience to people and independence to
princes.</p>

<p>And meanwhile every heretic against the Holy
Catholic and Orthodox Faith, as accepted by the
fathers assembled in the Church of St. John, was excommunicated,
and there followed these provisions:</p>

<p>“When condemned, the secular powers, or their
representatives, being present, they shall be delivered
to these for punishment, the clerics being previously
degraded from their orders. The property of laymen
shall be confiscated; that of clerics bestowed upon
their churches. Persons marked with suspicion only
shall, unless they can clear themselves, be smitten
with the sword of anathema, and shunned by all. If
they persist for a year in excommunication, they shall
be condemned as heretics.</p>

<p>“Secular powers must be moved or led, or at need
compelled by ecclesiastical censure, to make public
oath for the defence of the faith, as they themselves
desire to be esteemed faithful, undertaking to labour
with all their power to extirpate from their dominions
those whom the Church shall denounce as heretics.”<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The excommunication that was to wait upon disobedience
was no empty threat, nor yet was it
concerned alone with the spiritual part of man. The
Pope’s anathema imposed the same penalties upon
those against whom it was launched as the Druid’s
curse had imposed of old.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a></p>

<p>Persons under the ban of the Church might hold
no office, nor claim any of the ordinary rights of
citizenship, or, indeed, of existence. In sickness or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
distress none might show them charity under pain of
incurring the same curse, nor after death should their
bodies be given Christian burial.</p>

<p>By these provisions and injunctions the Inquisition
may be said to have entered upon the second stage of
its evolution, and to have assumed a strictly ecclesiastical
character&mdash;in short, to be canonically established.</p>

<p>It was Pope Innocent III who placed in the hands
of the Church this terrible weapon of persecution, and
who, by the awful severity of his own attitude towards
liberty of conscience, of thought, and of expression,
afforded to fanaticism and religious intolerance an
example that was to be their merciless guide through
centuries to come.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III<br />

<span class="medium">THE ORDER OF ST. DOMINIC</span></h2>

<p><i>“If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and
give to the poor, and thou shall have treasure in heaven;
and come and follow Me!”</i></p>

<p>The contrast between the condition thus enjoined
by the Founder of Christianity and the worldly position
occupied by His Vicar on earth was now fast approaching
the climax which was to become absolute
with the era of the Renaissance.</p>

<p>From the simple folk foregathering in Rome in
the middle of the first century to discuss and to guide
one another in the practice of the new doctrine of love
and humility, conveyed by word of mouth from the
East, in all its pristine simplicity, unburdened as yet
by theological complexities, unfettered by formularies,
it is a far cry indeed to the proud curial Christians of
the Rome of Pope Innocent III.</p>

<p>The successor of Peter, the poor fisherman of
Galilee, was enthroned with a splendour outrivalling
that of any other earthly potentate. Temporally he
was lord of considerable dominions; spiritually he
claimed empire over the entire Christian world, and
maintained his supremacy with the thunderbolts of
anathema which he had forged himself. His glittering
court was thronged with rustling, scarlet prelates, with
patricians in cloth of gold and silver, captains in steel,
mincing fops and stately senators. He was arrayed in
garments woven of the very finest fleece, crowned with
the triple diadem of white peacock feathers within
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
three flaming circlets of precious stones. On his
coronation kings served him upon the knee at table;
throughout his reign princes and patricians were his
lackeys.</p>

<p>From the steps of the Lateran on the day of his
accession he would fling a handful of money to the
Roman crowd, exclaiming: “Gold and silver are not
for me. What I have I give to thee.”</p>

<p>Yet his riches were vast, their sources almost inexhaustible.
The luxury in which he lived and
moved was the most sumptuous that wealth could
command and art and artifice produce.</p>

<p>Nor was this ecclesiastical magnificence confined
to Rome and the Papal Court. Gradually it had
come to permeate the entire body clerical until it had
affected even the monastic orders. From the simplicity
of their beginnings these orders had developed
into baronial institutions. The fathers presided in
noble abbeys over wide tracts of arable and vineyard
which they owned and cultivated, and over rural
districts and parishes, which they governed and taxed
as feudal lords rather than served as priests.</p>

<p>So arrogant and aristocratic was become the spirit
of a clergy whose mission was to preach the sublimest
and most ideal of democratic doctrines, that the Church
seemed no longer within the reach of plebeian and
peasant-folk. It was fast becoming an institution of
patricians for patricians.</p>

<p>How long this state of things might have endured,
what results might have attended its endurance, it
were perhaps idle to speculate. That a change was
wrought, that provision was made for the lowly and
the poor, is due to the advent of two men as similar in
much as in much else they were dissimilar. They met
in Rome at the foot of the pontifical throne.</p>

<p>Either might have been the founder of a religion
had he not found already in the world an ideal religion
which he could serve. Both were men born into easy
circumstances of life; one, Francesco Bernardone, was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
the son of a wealthy merchant of Assisi; the other,
Domingo de Guzman, of Calahorra, was a nobleman
of Spain.</p>

<p>To-day the Church includes them in her Calendar
as St. Francis of Assisi and St. Dominic. They are
the resplendent twain whom Dante beheld together
in his “Paradise”:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“L’un fu tutto serafico in ardore,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">L’altro per sapienza in terra fue<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Di cherubica luce un splendore.”<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a><br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>St. Francis&mdash;through the sweetness and tenderness
that emanated from his poetic, mystic nature, the most
lovable of all the saints&mdash;came from his native Assisi
to implore the Father of Fathers to permit him to
band together into an order the barefoot companions
he had already gained, to the end that they should
practise Christ’s injunction of poverty and self-abnegation,
and minister to the afflicted.</p>

<p>St. Dominic&mdash;and our concern is more with him&mdash;had
been chosen for his eloquence and learning to
accompany the Bishop of Osma upon an inquisitorial
journey into Southern France. There he had witnessed
the fierce carnage that was toward. He had
preached to the heretics at Toulouse, and the burning,
passionate eloquence of his oratory had made converts
of many of those who were prepared to resist the
cruel arguments of fire and steel.</p>

<p>In the ardour of his zeal he had flung aside his
rank and the ease and dignity it afforded him. Like
St. Francis he went barefoot, embracing poverty and
self-denial; yet, less mystical, less tender, entirely practical
where the propagation of the Faith was concerned,
he had exulted in the bloody victories that Simon de
Montfort had won over the heretical Albigenses.</p>

<p>Yet, if he gloried in the end achieved&mdash;conceiving
it the supremest of all human ends&mdash;he must have
been touched with regret for the means employed.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span></p>

<p>He has been termed a fierce and cruel zealot.
But ferocity and cruelty do not go hand in hand with
such lowly humility as undoubtedly was his. And
the very object of his mission to Rome permits, if it
does not point to, a very different conclusion. He
went deploring the bloodshed he had witnessed,
however greatly he may have prized the fruits of it.
Inspired by the success that had attended his oratory,
he aimed at providing other and gentler means by
which in the first instance to seek the attainment of
the same ends. He went to implore Pope Innocent’s
leave to found an order of preachers who in poverty
and lowliness should go abroad to win back to the
Roman fold the sheep that had strayed into heretical
pastures.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Pope Innocent considered the simultaneous requests
of both these men&mdash;requests which, springing from the
same passionate fervour in both, yet came by different,
if similar, channels to a sort of unity in the end.</p>

<p>He perceived the services which such men as
these might render to the Church, endowed as they
were with the magnetic power of creating followings,
of inflaming hearts, and replenishing the flickering
lamp of public zeal.</p>

<p>He detected no heresy, no irony, in the cult of
pauperdom which they would go forth to preach under
the sanction and charter of the luxurious, aristocratic,
curial court.</p>

<p>But there existed another obstacle to his granting
them their prayers. So numerous already were the
monastic orders that a Council of the Lateran had
decreed that no more should be created. Favouring
these petitioners, however, he was applying himself to
the surmounting of the difficulty when death took him.</p>

<p>Thus the burden of solving this problem was thrust
upon his successor, Honorius III. And it is said that
the new pope was spurred to discover a solution by
a dream&mdash;which has been made the subject of a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
fresco by Bennozzo Gozzoli&mdash;in which he beheld this
saintly pair supporting with their hands the tottering
Lateran.</p>

<p>Since he could not establish them and their followers
as monastic fathers, he had recourse to creating
brotherhoods for them. These brotherhoods, he affiliated
to the order of St. Augustine, the Dominicans
as friars-preachers (<i>fratres predicatores</i>) and the Franciscans
as friars-minors (<i>fratres minores</i>).</p>

<p>Thus were launched these two mendicant orders,
which by the enormous following they were so soon
to win, were destined to become one of the greatest
means of power of the Roman Church.</p>

<p>In the lifetime of their founders the fundamental
laws of poverty were observed in all their intended
purity. But soon thereafter, being men under their
rough habits, and susceptible to the ambition that
is man’s, upon the acquisition of power followed
the acquisition of wealth. Their founders had accomplished
a renascence of the original spirit of
Christianity. But soon this began to undergo modification,
and to respond to worldly influences, until the
history of the friars-mendicant repeats and mirrors
the history of Christianity itself. In a measure as
they spread through Christendom, so they acquired
convents, lands, and property as they went. The
personal poverty of each brother remained, it is true;
they still went abroad barefoot and coarsely garbed,
“without staff, or bag, or bread, or money,” as their
rule decreed. Individually they kept the vow of privation;
but considered collectively their poverty
“remained outside the convent gate,” as Gregorovius
says, echoing what Dante had said before him.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span></p>

<p>For the service of the Church the friars-mendicant
became a splendid army, and an army, moreover,
whose maintenance made no draught upon the pontifical
treasury, since, by virtue of their mendicancy,
the orders were entirely self-supporting. And whilst
both orders, magnificently organized, grew extremely
powerful, the Dominicans became formidable through
their control of that Inquisition whose early stirrings
had inspired St. Dominic to his task.</p>

<p>His aim had been to found a preaching order whose
special mission should be the overthrow of heresy
wherever found. The brethren were to combat it,
employing their eloquence on the one hand to induce
the heretic to abjure his error, on the other to inflame
the faithful against him, so that terror should accomplish
what might not be possible to persuasion.</p>

<p>It may be that this mission which they had made
specially their own, as their founder ordained, peculiarly
fitted the Dominicans to assume the government
of an ecclesiastical establishment whose aim was
identical. It was this order of St. Dominic that was
to erect the grim edifice of the Holy Office, and to
develop and assume entire control of the terrible
machinery of the Inquisition. Their persuasion was
to be the ghastly persuasion of the rack; their eloquence
was to be the burning eloquence of the tongues
of material flame that should lick their agonizing
victims out of existence. And all for the love of
Christ!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Although it might be difficult to show&mdash;as has
been attempted&mdash;that Domingo de Guzman himself
was actually the first ordained Inquisitor, nevertheless
as early as 1224, within three years of his death, the
Inquisition in Italy and elsewhere was already entirely
in the hands of the Dominicans. This is shown by
a constitution promulgated at Padua in February of
that year by the Emperor Frederic II. It contains
the following announcement:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span></p>

<p>“Be it known to all that we have received under
our special protection the preaching friars of the order
of preachers, sent into our Empire on business of the
Faith against heretics, and likewise all who may lend
them assistance&mdash;as much in going as in abiding and
returning&mdash;save such as are already prescribed; and
it is our wish that all should give them favour and
assistance; wherefore we order our subjects to receive
benignly any of the said friars whenever and wherever
they may arrive, keeping them secure from the enmity
of heretics, assisting them in every way to accomplish
their ministry regarding the business of the Faith....
And we do not doubt that you will render homage
to God and our Empire by collaborating with the said
friars to deliver our Empire from the new and unusual
infamy of heretical pravity.”<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The constitution decreed that heretics when so
condemned by the Church and delivered over to the
secular arm should be condignly punished; that if
any, through the fear of death, should desire to return
to the faith, he should receive the penance that might
be imposed canonically and be imprisoned for life;
that if in any part of the Empire heretics should be
discovered by the inquisitors or by other zealous
Catholics, the civil powers should be under the obligation
of effecting their arrest at the request of the said
inquisitors or other Catholics, and of holding them in
safe custody until excommunicated by the Church,
when they should be burnt; that the same punishment
should be suffered by <i>fautores</i>&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> those guilty of
concealing or defending heretics; that fugitives be
sought for, and that converts from the same heresy
be employed to discover them.</p>

<p>Odious as was this last enactment, there was yet
worse contained in the Emperor’s constitution. It was
decreed that “the sin of <i>l&egrave;se-Majest&eacute; divine</i> being, as
it is, greater than that of <i>l&egrave;se-Majest&eacute; humaine</i>, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
God being the avenger of the sins of the fathers on
the children, to the end that these may not imitate
the sins of those, the descendants of heretics to the
second generation shall be deemed incapable of honours
or of holding any public office&mdash;<i>excepting the innocent
children who shall denounce the iniquity of their
fathers</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a></p>

<p>The barbarous provision here given in italics calls
for no comment.</p>

<p>Within four years of issuing that harsh proclamation
against all rebels from the sway of Rome,
Frederic himself, in rebellion against the pontiff’s
temporal sway, was to feel the lash of excommunication.
But with that we have no concern. After his
reconciliation with the Pope he renewed the constitution
of 1224, adding a provision concerning
blasphemers, who, in common with heretics of whatever
sect, should suffer death by fire; yet if the
bishops should desire to save any such, this could
only be done subject to the offender’s being deprived
of his tongue, so that never again should he blaspheme
God.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the year 1227 Ugolino Conti, who had been a
friend of Dominic and of Francis, ascended the papal
throne under the style of Gregory IX.</p>

<p>It was this pontiff who, carrying forward the
work that had been undertaken in that direction by
Innocent III, gave the Inquisition a stable form.
He definitely placed the control of it in the hands of
the Dominican friars, giving them, where necessary, the
assistance of the Franciscans. But the participation
of the latter in the business of that terrible tribunal is
so slight as to be insignificant.</p>

<p>Gregory’s bull, given in “Raynaldus,”<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> is one of
excommunication against all heretics.</p>

<p>Further, it ordains that all condemned by the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
Church shall be delivered to the secular arm for
punishment, all clerics so delivered being first degraded
from their orders; that should any wish to abjure
his heresy and return to the Church, penance shall be
imposed upon him, and he shall suffer perpetual imprisonment.
Abettors, concealers, and defenders of
heretics are similarly excommunicated; and if any
such shall neglect to procure absolution within one
year, he shall be accounted <i>infamous</i>, and shall be
neither eligible for any public office nor the elector of
any other, nor act as witness, testator, inheritor, nor
have power to seek justice when wronged. If a judge,
no proceedings shall be laid before him, and his sentences,
where passed, shall be null and void; if an
advocate, he shall not have faculty to plead; if a notary,
his deeds shall be void; if a cleric, he shall be deposed
from his office and benefices.</p>

<p>Similarly, the ban of excommunication shall fall
upon those who hold traffic with any who are excommunicated,
and they shall further be punished with
other penalties.</p>

<p>Those who are under suspicion of heresy, unless
they see to it that they overcome the suspicion either
by canonical purgation or otherwise according to the
quality of the person and the motives for the suspicion,
shall be excommunicated, and if they do not give
condign satisfaction within one year, they shall be
deemed heretics. Their claims or appeals shall not
then be admitted, nor shall judges, advocates, or
notaries exercise their functions in favour of them;
priests shall refuse to administer the sacraments to
them and to admit their alms or oblations, and so
shall the Templars and Hospitallers and other regular
orders, under pain of loss of office, from which naught
can save them but a mandate from the Holy See.</p>

<p>Should any give Christian burial to one who has
died under excommunication, he shall himself incur
excommunication, from which he shall not be delivered
until with his own hands he shall have exhumed the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
corpse, and so disposed that the place may never again
be used for sepulture.</p>

<p>Should any know of the existence of heretics or of
any who practise secret conventicles or whose ways
of living are uncommon, they are bound under pain of
excommunication to divulge the same to their confessor
or other by whom they believe it will come to the
knowledge of their prelate.</p>

<p>Children of heretics and of the abettors or concealers
of heretics shall be deprived until the second
generation of holding any public office or benefice.</p>

<p>To the provisions of this bull, additions were made
by the civil governor of Rome, as representing the
secular arm whose concern it would be to inflict the
punishments regarding which the Church refrained
from being explicit&mdash;confining herself to the promise
that they should be “condign.”</p>

<p>He provided that: those arrested should be detained
in prison until condemned by the Church, when,
after eight days, they should be punished.</p>

<p>Their property should be confiscated, one-third
going to the delator, one-third to the judge who should
pronounce sentence, and one-third to repair the walls
of Rome, or otherwise as might be considered.</p>

<p>The dwellings of heretics or of any who should
consciously have entertained heretics should be razed
to the ground.</p>

<p>If any man should have knowledge of the existence
of heretics and fail to denounce them he should be fined
the sum of 20 livres. Should he lack the means to
pay, he was to be banished until he could find them.</p>

<p>Abettors and concealers of heretics should for the
first offence suffer confiscation of one-third of their
property, to be applied to keeping the walls of Rome
in repair. If the offence were repeated, then they
should be banished for ever.</p>

<p>All who were elected senators must swear before
taking office that they would observe all laws against
heretics; and were any to refuse this oath his acts as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
senator would be null and void and none should be
obliged to follow or obey him, whilst those who might
have sworn obedience to him were absolved of their
oath. Should a senator accept this oath but afterwards
refuse or neglect to respect its terms, he must incur the
penalties of perjury, suffer a fine of 200 silver marks,
to be applied to the repairing of the walls, and become
ineligible for any public office.</p>

<p>Two years later&mdash;in 1233&mdash;at a Council held at
B&eacute;ziers, the papal legate, Gaultier of Tournai, elaborated
these canons by the following provisions:</p>

<p>“All magistrates, nobles, vassals, and others shall
diligently seek to discover, apprehend, and punish
heretics wherever found. Every parish in which a
heretic is discovered shall pay as a penalty for having
harboured him one silver mark to the person who shall
have discovered him. All houses in which heretics
may have preached shall be demolished and the property
confiscated, and fire shall be set to all caves and
other hiding-places where heretics are alleged to be
concealed. All the property of heretics shall be confiscated,
and their children shall inherit nothing. Their
abettors, concealers, or defenders shall be dealt with
in the same manner. Any persons suspected of heresy
must make public profession of faith upon oath, under
pain of suffering as heretics; they shall be compelled
to attend divine service on every feast-day, and all
who are <i>reconciled</i> to the Church shall wear as a distinguishing
badge two crosses externally on their
garments&mdash;one on the breast, the other on the back&mdash;both
of yellow cloth, three fingers in width, the vertical
limb measuring 2&frac12; hands, the horizontal one 2 hands.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a>
If a hood is worn, this must bear a third cross&mdash;all
under pain of being deemed heretics and suffering
confiscation of property.”<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>These enactments by their uncompromising harshness
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
abundantly reveal the extent to which heretics
were execrated by the Church in her intolerance and
her firm determination to extirpate them. They also
reveal something of the far-reaching, pitiless, priestly
subtlety and craft which were to render so terrible
this tribunal.</p>

<p>The provisions for the punishment of those who
should be moved by Christian charity to succour any
of the persecuted were devised to the end that terror
should stifle all such compassion; whilst the decree
that the children of convicted heretics should suffer
disinheritance and become ineligible for any honourable
appointment was calculatedly introduced to forge
a further weapon out of parental love. Where a man
might readily, himself, have endured martyrdom for
his convictions, he would be made to pause before
including his children in the same sacrifice, before
suffering them to go destitute and branded.</p>

<p>In the eyes of the Church the end in view could
not fail to justify any means that might be employed.
The extirpation of heresy was a consummation so
very fervently to be desired that any steps&mdash;almost
any sin&mdash;would be condonable if conducive to that
end.</p>

<p>It has been argued that this crusade against heresy
was political, a campaign waged by the Church to
protect herself from the onslaught of liberty of thought,
which was threatening her overthrow. Such no doubt
had been the case in earlier centuries; but it was
so no longer. Roman Catholicism had grown and
spread like a mighty tree, until her shadow lay across
the face of Europe and her roots were thrust far and
wide into the soil. These had taken too firm a hold,
they were too full of vigour, to permit that the
withering of an occasional branch should give her
concern for the vitality of the growth itself. She
had no such concern. However abominable, however
feral, however unchristian even, may have been
the institution of the Holy Office, it is difficult to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
think that the spirit in which it was founded was
other than pure and disinterested.</p>

</div>

<p>It may seem bitterly ironical that men should
have been found who in the name of the meek and
compassionate Christ relentlessly racked and burnt
their fellow-creatures. It was&mdash;bitterly, deplorably,
tragically ironical. But they were not conscious of
the irony. In what they did they were sincere&mdash;as
sincere as St. Augustine when he urged the extermination
of heretics; and none can call in question his
sincerity or the purity of his motives.</p>

<p>To understand their attitude it is but necessary to
consider the absolute belief that was the Catholics’ in
what Lecky calls “the doctrine of exclusive salvation.”
Starting from the premise that the Church of Rome
is the true and only Church of Christ, they held that
no salvation was possible for any man who was not
a member of it. Nor could ignorance&mdash;however
absolute&mdash;of the true faith be urged as an excuse
for error, any more than may ignorance of the law
be pleaded in the worldly courts to-day. Thus, not
only did they account irrevocably damned those who
schismatically deserted from the Church, and those
who like Jew and Moslem remained deliberately outside
its walls, but similarly&mdash;such was man’s indifferently
flattering conception of divine justice and divine
intelligence&mdash;the savages who had never so much as
heard the name of Christ, and the very babe who died
before his heritage of Original Sin could be washed
away by the baptismal waters. Indeed, fathers of the
Church had waged heated wars of controversy concerning
the precise moment at which pre-natal life
sets in, and, consequently, damnation is incurred by
the soul of the fœtus should it perish in the womb.</p>

<p>When it is considered that such doctrines were
held dogmatically, it will be realized that in the sight
of the Church&mdash;whose business was the salvation of
souls&mdash;there could be no sin so intolerable, so execrable,
as heresy. It will be realized how it happened that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
the Church could consider those of her children who
were guilty of such crimes as murder, rape, adultery,
and the sin of the Cities of the Plain, with the tolerance
of an indulgent parent, whilst rising up in intolerant
wrath to smite the heretic whose life might be a model
of pure conduct. The former were guilty of only the
sins of weak humanity; and sinners who have the faith
may seek forgiveness, and find it in contrition. But
heresy was not merely the worst of sins, as some have
held. In the eyes of the Church it transcended the
realm of sin&mdash;it was infinitely worse than sin, because
it represented a state that was entirely hopeless, a state
not to be redeemed or mitigated by good actions or
purity of life.</p>

<p>Taking this view of heresy, the Church accounted
it her duty to stamp out this awful soul-pestilence so
as to prevent its spreading; and she had St. Augustine’s
word for it that it was merciful to be merciless
in the attainment of that object. When viewed, as it
were, from within, there is nothing illogical in the attitude
of the Church towards heresy. What is illogical
is the conception of God that is involved in the doctrine
of exclusive salvation.</p>

<p>Even if we survey the case of Galileo&mdash;one of the
most illustrious prisoners ever arraigned before the
tribunal of the Holy Office&mdash;we have no just cause to
suppose that, in demanding his retraction of the theory
of the earth’s movement round the sun, the inquisitors
were inspired by any motives beyond the fear lest the
spread of a notion&mdash;honestly deemed by them to be
an illusion&mdash;should disturb man’s faith in the Biblical
teaching with which it was in conflict.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV<br />

<span class="medium">ISABELLA THE CATHOLIC</span></h2>

<p>Llorente agrees with the earlier writers on the
subject in considering the Spanish Inquisition as an
institution distinct from that which had been established
to deal with the Albigenses and their coevals
in heresy. It is distinct only in that it represents a
further development of the organization launched by
Innocent III and perfected by Gregory IX.</p>

<p>Before entering upon the consideration of this
Modern Inquisition&mdash;as it is called&mdash;it will perhaps be
well to take a survey of the Spain of the Catholic
Sovereigns&mdash;Ferdinand and Isabella&mdash;in whose reign
that tribunal was set up in Castile.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>For seven hundred years, with varying fortune and
in varying degree, the Saracen had lorded it in the
Peninsula.</p>

<p>First had come Berber Tarik, in 711, to overthrow
the Visigothic Kingdom of Roderic, to spread the
Moslem dominion as far as the mountains in the north
and east and west from sea to sea. When the Berber
tribe, the Syrians, and the Arabs had fallen to
wrangling among themselves, Abdurrahman the
Omayyad crossed from Africa to found the independent
amirate, which in the tenth century became
the Caliphate of Cordova.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Christians had been consolidating
their forces in the mountain fastnesses of the north to
which they had been driven, and under Alfonso I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
they founded the Kingdom of Galicia. Thence,
gradually but irresistibly, presenting a bold front to
the Moorish conqueror, they forced their way down
into the plains of Leon and Castile, so that by the
following century they had driven the Saracens south
of the Tagus. Following up their advantage, they
continued to press them, intent upon driving them into
the sea, and they might have succeeded but for the
coming of Yusuf ben Techufin, who checked the
Christian conquest, hurled them back across the Tagus,
and, master of the country to the south of it, founded
there the Empire of the Almoravides.</p>

<p>After these came the Almohades&mdash;the followers of
the Mahdi&mdash;and the land rang for half a century with
the clash of battle between Cross and Crescent,
Castile, Leon, Aragon, and the new-born Kingdom
of Portugal striving side by side to crush the common
foe at Navas de Tolosa.</p>

<p>In 1236 Leon and Castile&mdash;now united into one
kingdom&mdash;in alliance with Aragon, wrested Cordova
from the Moors; in 1248 Seville was conquered, and
in 1265 Diego of Aragon drove the Saracen from
Murcia, and thereby reduced the Moslem occupation
to Granada and a line of Mediterranean seaboard
about Cadiz, in which they remained until Ferdinand
of Aragon and Isabella of Castile, by virtue of their
marriage, had united the two crowns on the death (in
1474) of Henry IV, Isabella’s brother.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Ferdinand brought, with Aragon, Sicily, Sardinia,
and Naples; Isabella brought, with Castile, Leon
and the rest of the Spanish territory, saving Granada
and that portion of the coast still in Moorish hands.
And thus was founded, by the welding of these
several principalities into one single state, that mighty
Kingdom of Spain which Columbus was so soon to
enrich by a new world.</p>

<p>But though founded by this marriage, this kingdom
still required consolidating and subjecting. Generations
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
of misrule in Castile, culminating in the lax
reigns of John II and Henry IV, had permitted the
spread of a lawlessness so utter that its like was not
to be found in any other state at that time. Anarchy
was paramount mistress of the land, and Pulgar has
left us a striking picture of the impossible conditions
that prevailed.</p>

<p>“In those days,” he writes, “justice suffered, and
was not to be done upon the malefactors who
plundered and tyrannized in townships and on the
highways. None paid debts who did not want to do
so; none was restrained from committing any crime,
and none dreamed of obedience or subjection to a
superior. What with present and past wars, people
were so accustomed to turbulence that he who did not
do violence to others was held to be a man of no
account.</p>

<p>Citizens, peasants, and men of peace were not
masters of their own property, nor could they have
recourse to any for redress of the wrongs they suffered
at the hands of governors of fortresses and other
thieves and robbers. Every man would gladly have
engaged to give the half of his property if at that price
he might have purchased security and peace for
himself and his family. Often there was talk in towns
and villages of forming brotherhoods to remedy all
these evils. But a leader was wanting who should have
at heart the justice and tranquillity of the Kingdom.”<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a></p>

<p>The nobility, as may be conceived&mdash;and, indeed,
as Pulgar clearly indicates&mdash;were not only tainted
with the general lawlessness, but were themselves the
chief offenders, each man a law unto himself, a
tyrannical, extortionate ruler of his vassals, lord of life
and death, unscrupulously abusing his power, little
better than a highway robber, caring nothing for the
monarchy so long as the monarchy left him undisturbed,
ready to rebel against it should it attempt to
curtail his brigandage.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span></p>

<p>To crush these and other unruly elements in the
state, to resolve into order the chaos that had invaded
every quarter of the kingdom, was the task which at
the outset the young Queen perceived awaiting her&mdash;a
task that must have daunted any mind less virile,
any spirit less vigorous.</p>

<p>And there were other and more pressing matters
demanding her instant attention if she were to retain
her seat upon this almost bankrupt throne of Castile
which she had inherited from her brother.</p>

<p>Alfonso V of Portugal was in arms, invading her
frontiers to dispute, on his niece Juana’s behalf,
Isabella’s right.</p>

<p>Henry IV had left no legitimate issue, but his wife
Juana of Portugal had brought forth in wedlock a
daughter of whom she pretended that he was the
father, whilst the King of Portugal, to serve interests
of his own, recognized the girl as his legitimate niece.
Public opinion, however, hesitated so little to proclaim
her bastardy that it had named her La Beltraneja,
after Beltran de la Cueva who notoriously had been
her mother’s lover. And what Beltran de la Cueva,
himself, thought about it, may be inferred from the
circumstance that in the ensuing struggle he was
found fighting for the honour of Castile under the
banner of Queen Isabella.</p>

<p>The war demanded all the attention and resources
of the Catholic Monarchs, and Isabella’s own share
in these labours was conspicuous. They resulted in
the rout of the Portuguese supporters of the pretender
at Toro in 1476. By that victory Isabella was
securely seated upon her throne and became joint
ruler with Ferdinand of Castile and Aragon.</p>

<p>She was twenty-five years of age at the time, a
fair, shapely woman of middle height, with a clear
complexion, eyes between green and blue, and a
gracious, winsome countenance remarkable for its
habitual serenity. Such, indeed, was her self-control,
Pulgar tells us, that not only did she carefully conceal
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
her anger when it was aroused, but even in childbirth
she could “dissemble her feelings, betraying no
sign or expression of the pain to which all women are
subject.” He adds that she was very ceremonious in
dress and equipage, that she was deliberate of gesture,
quick-witted, and ready of tongue, and that in the
midst of the labour of government&mdash;and very arduous
labour, as shall be seen&mdash;she found time to learn Latin,
so that she could understand all that was said in that
tongue.</p>

<p>“She was a zealous Catholic and very charitable,
yet in her judgments she inclined rather to rigour than
to mercy. She listened to counsel, but acted chiefly
upon her own opinions. Of a rare fidelity to her word,
she never failed to fulfil that to which she had pledged
herself, save where compelled by stress of circumstance.
She was reproached, together with her husband, of
being wanting in generosity, because, seeing the royal
patrimony diminished by the alienation of fiefs and
castles, she was always very careful of such concessions.</p>

<p>“‘Kings,’ she was wont to say, ‘should preserve
with care their dominions, because in alienating them
they lose at once the money necessary to make themselves
beloved and the power to make themselves
feared.’”<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a></p>

<p>Such is the portrait that Pulgar has left us, and
considering that he is writing of a sovereign, it would
be no more than reasonable to suspect flattery and
that curious, undiscriminating enthusiasm which never
fails to create panegyrists when it is a question of
depicting a prince, however inept, to his contemporaries.
But if Pulgar has erred in this instance, it
has been on the side of moderation in his portrayal of
this gifted, high-spirited woman.</p>

<p>Her actions speak more eloquently of her character
than can the pen of any chronicler, and it is in the
deeds of princes that we must seek their true natures,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
not in what may have been written of them in their
own day. The deeds of Isabella’s life&mdash;with one dark
exception that is the subject of this history&mdash;more
than bear out all that Pulgar and others have set down
in praise of her.</p>

<p>No sooner had she overthrown those who came
from abroad to dispute her right to the crown than
she turned her attention to the subjugation of those
who disputed her authority at home. In this herculean
labour she had the assistance of Alonzo de Quintanilla,
her chancellor, and Juan Ortega, the King’s sacristan.
These men proposed to organize at their own risk one
of those brotherhoods which Pulgar mentions as having
been so ardently desired by the country for its protection
from those who preyed upon it. This <i>hermandad</i>
was to act under royal sanction and guidance,
with the object of procuring peace and protection of
property in the kingdom. Isabella readily approved
the proposal, and the brotherhood was immediately
founded, a tax to support it being levied upon those
in whose interest it was established, and very willingly
paid by them.</p>

<p>Splendidly organized, this association, half military,
half civil, so effectively discharged the functions for
which it was created, that twenty years later&mdash;in 1498&mdash;it
was possible to abolish it, and to replace it by a
much simpler and less costly system of police which
then sufficed to preserve the order that had been
restored.</p>

<p>Further to subject the turbulent and insubordinate
nobility, Isabella employed methods similar to those
adopted in like case by her neighbour, Louis XI
of France. She bestowed the offices of state upon
men of merit without regard to birth, which hitherto
had been accounted the only qualification. The career
of the law was thrown open to the burgher classes,
and every office under the crown was made accessible
to lawyers, who thus became the staunch friends of the
sovereign.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span></p>

<p>If the nobles did not dare to revolt, at least they
protested in the strongest terms against these two
innovations that so materially affected and weakened
their prestige. They represented in particular that
the institution of the <i>hermandad</i> was the manifestation
of a want of confidence in the “faithful nobility,” and
they implored that four members of their order should
be appointed by the Catholic Sovereigns to form a
council of supreme direction of the affairs of State,
as under the late King Henry IV.</p>

<p>To this the Catholic Sovereigns replied that the
<i>hermandad</i> was a tutelary institution which was very
welcome to the country, and which it was their
pleasure to maintain. As for the offices of State, it
was for the sovereigns to appoint such men as they
considered best qualified to hold them. The nobles,
they added, were free to remain at Court or to withdraw
to their own domains, as they might see fit; but
as for the sovereigns, themselves, as long as it should
please God to preserve them in the high position in
which He had deigned to place them, it should be
their care not to imitate the monarch who was cited to
them as an example, and not to become puppets in the
hands of their “faithful nobility.”</p>

<p>That answer gave the nobles pause. It led them
to perceive that a change had taken place, and that
the lawless days of Henry IV were at an end. To
have made them realize this was something. But
there was more to be done before they would understand
that they must submit to the altered conditions,
and Isabella pursued the policy she had adopted with
an unswerving directness, as the following story from
Pulgar’s Chronicle bears witness:</p>

<p>A quarrel had broken out in the Queen’s palace at
Valladolid between Don Fadrique Enriquez (son of
the Admiral of Castile) and Don Ramiro de Guzman.
Knowledge of it reached the Queen, and she ordered
both disputants to hold themselves under arrest in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
their own quarters until she should provide that judgment
be given between them by the Courts. Fadrique,
however, signified his contempt of the royal mandate
by disobeying it and continuing at large. Learning
this, Isabella gave the more obedient Guzman his
liberty, and the assurance of her word that he should
suffer no harm.</p>

<p>A few days later he was riding peacefully through
the street, secure in the Queen’s safe-conduct, when he
was set upon by three masked horsemen of the household
of Fadrique and severely beaten. No sooner did
the Queen hear of this further affront to her authority
than she got to horse, and rode through torrential rain
from Valladolid to the Admiral’s castle at Simancas.
In fact, in such haste did she set out that she rode
alone, without waiting for an escort. This, however,
followed presently, but did not come up with her save
under the very walls of the Admiral’s fortress.</p>

<p>She summoned the Admiral, and commanded him
to deliver up his rebellious son to her justice, and
when Don Alonso Enriquez protested that his son was
not there, she bade her followers search the castle
from battlements to dungeons. The search, however,
proved fruitless, and Isabella returned empty-handed
and indignant to Valladolid. Arrived there, she took
to her bed, and to those who came to seek news of her
health, she replied: “My body aches with the blows
delivered yesterday against my safe-conduct by Don
Fadrique.”</p>

<p>The Admiral, trembling before the royal wrath,
resolved to deliver up his son and cast him upon
the mercy of the Queen. So the Constable of
Castile&mdash;Fadrique’s uncle&mdash;undertook the office of
intercessor. He went with Don Fadrique to Valladolid,
and imploring Isabella to consider that the
young man was but in his twentieth year and that
he had sinned through the rashness of youth, begged
her to do upon him the justice she might wish or the
mercy that was due.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span></p>

<p>The Queen, however, was not to be moved to
mercy for offences that set her royal authority in
contempt. She was inexorable. She refused to see
the offender, and submitted him to the indignity of
being taken to prison through the streets of the city
by an alcalde. After a spell of confinement there she
banished him to Sicily, prohibiting his return to Spain
under pain of severest punishment.</p>

<p>It happened, however, that Don Ramiro de Guzman
did not consider his honour sufficiently avenged by his
enemy’s exile. One night, when the Court was at
Medina del Campo, he ambushed himself in his turn
with some followers of his own, and attacked the
Admiral, to return him the blows received from his
son. From this indignity the Admiral was saved by
his escort. But when Isabella heard of the affair, she
treated Guzman as a rebel, seized his castles in Leon
and Castile, as she would have seized his person, but
that to escape her anger he fled to Portugal for shelter.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>No less determined was her conduct in the matter
of the Grand-Mastership of Santiago.</p>

<p>There were in Spain three religio-military orders:
the Knights of Alcantara, the celibate Knights of
Calatrava&mdash;who were the successors of the Knights
Templars&mdash;and the Knights of Santiago. This last
order had been founded for the purpose of affording
protection to the pilgrims who came into Spain to
visit the shrine at Compostella of St. James the
Apostle, who is alleged to have been the first to bear
the message of Christianity into the Iberian Peninsula.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a>
These pilgrimages, chiefly from France, were a great
source of revenue to the country, and it became of
importance to ensure their immunity from the predatory
hordes that infested the highways. Further,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
the Knights of Santiago had found employment for
their arms in the crusade waged on Spanish soil
against the Moors, in token whereof they wore the
Crusader’s cross in red upon their white cloaks. They
acquired great power and wealth, possessing castles
and convents in every part of Spain, so that the office
of Grand Master of the Order was one of great weight
and importance&mdash;too great, in the opinion of Isabella,
to be in the hands of a subject.</p>

<p>This opinion she boldly manifested in 1476, when
the death of Don Rodrigo Manrique left the office vacant.
She took horse, as was her custom, and rode to Huete,
where the Chapter of the Order was assembled upon the
business of the necessary election, and she frankly urged
that to an office so exalted it was not fitting that any
but the King should be elected.</p>

<p>The proposal was not received with satisfaction.
Ferdinand was an Aragonese, and despite the union of
the two kingdoms which must be completed when he
should succeed to the throne of Aragon, he was still
looked upon as a foreigner by the Castilians. Under
Isabella’s insistence, however, a compromise was
effected. The Chapter consented to elect Ferdinand
to the office of Grand-Master on condition that he
should nominate a gentleman of Castile to act as his
deputy for the discharge of the duties of the position.
This was done, and Alonso de Cardenas&mdash;a loyal
servant of the Sovereigns&mdash;was chosen as the royal
deputy. Thus Isabella established it that the appointment
of Grand-Master of the Order of Santiago
should be a royal prerogative.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Even more strikingly than in either of the instances
cited does the Queen’s resolute, spirited nature manifest
itself in her manner of dealing with a revolt that took
place in Segovia at the commencement of her reign.</p>

<p>During the war with Portugal the Catholic Sovereigns
had entrusted their eldest daughter, the Princess
Isabella, to the care of Andr&eacute;s de Cabrera, the Seneschal
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
of the Castle of Segovia, and his wife, Beatriz de
Bobadilla.</p>

<p>Cabrera, a man of stern and rigid equity, had
occasion to depose his lieutenant, Alonso Maldonado,
from his office, conferring this upon his own brother-in-law,
Pedro de Bobadilla. Maldonado conspired to
avenge himself. He begged Bobadilla’s permission to
remove some stones that were in the castle, upon the
pretext that he required them for his own house, and
he sent some men of his own to fetch them. These
men, who were secretly armed, having gained admission,
stabbed the sentry and seized the person of
Bobadilla, whilst Maldonado, with other of his people,
took possession of the castle itself. The inmates of
the Alcazar, hearing the uproar, fled to the Homenaje
Tower, taking with them the Infanta, who was five
years of age at the time. Fortified in this, they defied
Maldonado when he attacked it. Finding it impregnable,
the rebel ordered Bobadilla to be brought
forward, and threatened the besieged that unless they
admitted him he would put the prisoner to death.</p>

<p>To this threat Cabrera’s dignified reply was that
Maldonado must do as he pleased, but the gates would
not be opened to him.</p>

<p>By this time a multitude of the townspeople had
gathered there, alarmed by the disturbance and armed
for any emergency. To these Maldonado cunningly
represented that what he was about was being done in
their interests against the overbearing tyranny of the
Governor, and he invited them to join hands with him
in the cause of liberty to complete the work he had
so excellently begun. The populace largely took sides
with him, so that Segovia was flung into a state of
war. There was constant fighting in the streets, and
the gates were in the hands of the rebels, with the
exception of that of St. John, which was held for
Cabrera.</p>

<p>It is believed that it was Maria de Bobadilla herself
who, stealing undetected from the Alcazar, escaped
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
from Segovia and bore to the Queen the news of what
was taking place, and the consequent peril of the royal
child.</p>

<p>Upon learning this, Isabella instantly repaired to
Segovia. The leaders of the rebellion had news of
her approach, but dared not carry their insubordination
to the length of closing the gates against her. They
went so far, however, as to ride out to meet her and
to attempt to deny admittance to her followers; and
her counsellors, seeing the humour of the populace,
urged her to be prudent and to accede to their wishes.
But her proud spirit flared up under that cautious
advice.</p>

<p>“Learn,” she cried, “that I am Queen of Castile,
that this city is mine, and that no conditions are to be
imposed upon me before I enter it. I shall enter,
then, and with me all those whom I may judge necessary
for my service.”</p>

<p>With that she ordered her escort forward, and
entered the city by a gate that was held by her
partisans, and so won through to the Alcazar.</p>

<p>Thither flocked the infuriated mob, and thundered
at the gates, demanding admission.</p>

<p>The Queen, notwithstanding the remonstrances of
the Cardinal of Spain and the Count of Benavente,
who were with her, ordered the gates to be thrown
open and as many admitted as the place would hold.
The populace surged into the courtyard, clamouring
for the Seneschal. To meet them came the slight,
fair young queen, alone and fearless, and when in their
astonishment they had fallen silent&mdash;</p>

<p>“People of Segovia,” she calmly addressed them,
“what do you seek?”</p>

<p>Dominated by her serenity, awed by her majesty,
their fury fell from them. Humbly now they urged
their grievance against Cabrera, accusing him of
oppression, and imploring of the Queen’s grace his
demission.</p>

<p>Instantly she promised them that their request
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
should be granted; whereupon the revulsion was
complete, and the mob that but a few moments earlier
had been yelling threats and execrations now raised
their voices loyally to acclaim her.</p>

<p>She commanded them to return to their homes and
their labours, and to leave the administration of justice
in her hands, sending her their ambassadors to prefer
their complaint against Cabrera, which she would investigate.</p>

<p>As she commanded so it was done, and when she
had examined the accusations against the Seneschal
and satisfied herself that they were groundless, she
announced him free from guilt and reinstated him in
his office, the conquered people bowing submissively
to her ruling.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a></p>

<p>In 1477 Isabella moved into Andalusia, in which
province, as elsewhere, law and order had ceased to
exist. She entered Seville with the proclaimed intention
of demanding an account of the guilty. But at
the very rumour of her approach and the business
upon which she came, some thousands of the inhabitants
whose consciences were uneasy made haste to
depart the city.</p>

<p>Alarmed by this depopulation, the Sevillans implored
the Queen to sheathe the sword of justice,
representing that after the bloody affrays that for
years had been afflicting the district there was scarcely
a family in which some member was not answerable to
the law.</p>

<p>Isabella, gentle and merciful by nature&mdash;which
renders her association with the Inquisition the more
deplorable&mdash;lent an ear to these representations, and
granted an amnesty for all crimes committed since the
death of Henry IV. But she was not so lenient with
those who had prostituted the justice which they
administered in her name. Informed of the judges
who were making a trade and extortion of their judgments,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
she punished them by deposition, and herself
fixed the scale of legal costs to be observed in future.</p>

<p>Finding a mass of impending law-suits which the
misrule of the past years had put upon the province,
she directed her attention to clearing up this Augean
stable. Every Friday, attended by her Council, she
sat in the great hall of the Alcazar of Seville to hear
the plaints of the most humble of her subjects; and
so earnestly and vigorously did she go to work that in
two months she had disposed of litigations that might
have dragged on for years.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Upon her accession she had found the royal
treasury exhausted by the inept administration of the
last two reigns and the prodigal, reckless grants that
Henry IV and Juan II had made to the nobles.
This condition of things had seriously embarrassed
the Catholic Sovereigns, and they had been driven to
various expedients to raise the requisite funds for the
war with Portugal. Now that the war was at an end,
they found themselves without the means necessary to
maintain the royal state.</p>

<p>Isabella made a close investigation of the grants
that had been made by her brother and father, and
she cancelled all those that were the fruit of caprice
and wantonness, restoring to the Crown the revenues
that had been recklessly alienated and the taxes that
the country had hitherto paid to none but the bandits
who oppressed it.</p>

<p>Similarly she found the public credit entirely
ruined. Under the late king such had been the laxity,
that in three years no less than 150 public mints had
been authorized, and this permitted such abuses that
a point had been reached where it almost seemed that
every Spaniard minted his own money, or that, as
Rosseeuw St. Hilaire puts it, “coining was the country’s
chief industry.”</p>

<p class="caption">POPE INNOCENT III. AND ST. DOMINIC.<br />
From a Fresco in the Church of the Sacro Speco, Subiaco.</p>
</div>

<p>She reduced the number of mints to five, and
exercised the severest control over their output,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
thereby liberating trade from the fear of fraud that
had been stifling it. An increased and steadily increasing
prosperity was the almost immediate result
of this wise measure.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Having restored order in the country, she turned
her attention to the Court, applied herself to the
purification of its morals, and set about converting it
from the disgusting licence that had prevailed in her
brother’s time.</p>

<p>Herself of a rigid chastity, she exacted the same
purity of conduct in all the women who approached
her, and she submitted the noble damsels brought up
at her Court to the very strictest surveillance. Loving
the King very sincerely, she was notoriously inclined
to jealousy: let him but look too assiduously upon any
lady of her train, and Isabella found a way to remove
her from the Court. She saw to it that the pages
who were in waiting upon her should be given a
good education, that thus they might avoid the idleness
which unfailingly leads to waste of character and to
immorality. Finally, according to Bernaldez,<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a> she extended
her moral reforms to the convents, which were
no less in need of them than the Court, and she corrected
and punished the great depravity that was
permeating all conventual orders.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a></p>

<p>There is no chronicler of her reign who does not
dilate upon her great piety. Bernaldez compares her
to St. Helena, the mother of the Emperor Constantine,<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
and describes her as very devoted to the Holy Faith
and very obedient to Holy Church. Bernaldez, of
course, was writing after the establishment of the
Inquisition, of which he, in common with other contemporary
and subsequent chroniclers, very warmly
approved; and he may have been very largely influenced
by consideration of the support which she
had unfortunately lent to its introduction into Castile.
But that her piety was extreme and sincere we infer
from the moment that we see her, after the battle
of Toro, which definitely gave her the crown, going
barefoot to church to a service of thanksgiving.</p>

<p>Yet, however ardent her piety, it would not carry
her the length of recognizing in the Pope the temporal
over-lord of Castile.</p>

<p>From the thirteenth century the power of the
Church had been increasing in Spain under the dogma
of the spiritual sovereignty of Rome over all the
Catholic churches of the world. The clergy had amassed
enormous wealth with that facility so peculiarly their
own when the occasion is afforded them, and to this
end they had abused the reckless, foolish liberality of
Isabella’s predecessors.</p>

<p>Lucius Marin&aelig;us informs us that the incomes of
the four archbishoprics&mdash;Toledo, Santiago, Seville,
and Granada&mdash;amounted to 134,000 ducats,<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a> whilst
those of the twenty bishoprics came to some 250,000
ducats.</p>

<p>Surrounded as she was by priestly counsellors
whom she respected, she nevertheless manifested
plainly her impatience of the clerical usurpation of the
rights of the Crown. The chief of these abuses was
no doubt that practised by the Pontiff himself, in
conferring upon foreigners the highest and richest
benefices of the Church of Spain, ignoring that it
was the prerogative of the Crown to name the bishops&mdash;always
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
subject to papal confirmation. That
Isabella, devout and priest-surrounded as she was,
should have dared to oppose the Holy See and the
terrible Pope Sixtus IV, as fearlessly as she had
opposed her predatory nobles, is perhaps the highest
proof that history can yield of her strength of
character.</p>

<p>Her smouldering indignation flared out when the
Pope, ignoring her nomination of her chaplain, Alonzo
de Burgos, to the vacant bishopric of Cuenca, appointed
his own nephew, Raffaele Riario, Cardinal of
San Sisto, to that vacant see.</p>

<p>Twice already had she sought the pontiff’s confirmation
of nominees of her own for other benefices&mdash;the
Archbishopric of Saragoza and the Bishopric of
Tarragona&mdash;and on each occasion her nominee had
been set aside in favour of a creature of the Pope’s.
But this third contemptuous disregard of her prerogative
was more than her patience could endure.
The Catholic Sovereigns refused to ratify the appointment
of Riario, and begged the Pope&mdash;submissively
at first&mdash;to cancel it.</p>

<p>But the harsh, overbearing Sixtus returned an
answer characteristic of his arrogant nature. It was
his, he announced, to distribute at his pleasure all the
benefices of Christendom; and he condescended to
explain that the power which it had pleased God to
confer upon him on earth could not be limited by
any will but his own, and that it was governed only
by the interests of the Catholic Faith, of which he
was the sole arbiter.</p>

<p>But his stubbornness met a stubbornness as great.
The Catholic Sovereigns replied by withdrawing
their ambassador from the Papal Court, and issuing
an injunction to all Spanish subjects to leave Rome.</p>

<p>Matters were becoming strained; an open rupture
impended between Spain and the Vatican. But the
Sovereigns had notified the Pope that it was their
intention to summon a general council of the Church
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
to settle the matter in dispute, and no Pope of those
days could contemplate with equanimity a general
council assembled for the purpose of sitting in judgment
upon his decrees. Whatever the result, since
at these councils the papal authority was questioned,
it must follow that thereafter that authority would be
impaired. Therefore this was the stock threat employed
to bring a recalcitrant pontiff to a reasonable
frame of mind.</p>

<p>It made Sixtus realize the strength of purpose that
was opposed to him; and, knowing as he did that this
resoluteness backed an undeniable right which he had
violated, he perceived that he dared carry insistence
no further. So, despite his earlier assertion that the
power which he held from God could be limited by
no will but his own and governed by no consideration
but that of the interests of the Faith, he gave way
completely.</p>

<p>The three royal nominees were duly confirmed in
the vacant sees, and Sixtus gave an undertaking that
in future he would make no appointments to the
benefices of Spain save of such ecclesiastics as the
Catholic Sovereigns should nominate.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a></p>

<p>It is to be added that in acting upon this signal
victory which she had won, Isabella used the faculty
it gave her with such pious wisdom, sincerity, and
discretion that had the Pope but followed her example
in the appointment of dignitaries, it would have contributed
to the greater honour and glory of the
Church. For she sternly opposed the granting of
benefices upon any grounds but those of absolute
merit.</p>

<p>Having won her way in this, she was the better
able to curb the predatory habits of her clergy by
edicts that limited their power to proper clerical confines.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“It is amazing,” comments Pulgar, “that a woman
should have been able, single-handed and in so little
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
time, by her judgment and perseverance to accomplish
what many men and great kings had been unable to
do in many years.”</p>

<p>“Properly to judge the notable improvements,”
says Rosseeuw St. Hilaire,<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a> “which this reign effected
in industry and agriculture, it would be necessary to
follow year by year the table of ordinances issued by
the Catholic Sovereigns. It would be seen that in
many things the genius of the founders of the Castilian
Monarchy forestalled the work of centuries. The
happy results of these reforms were soon experienced
everywhere: the highways were purged of malefactors,
new roads of communication were opened up,
rivers were bridged, consular tribunals established
in commercial centres, consulates created in Flanders,
England, France, and Italy; with maritime commerce
expanding daily and in a measure with the progress
of industry, new buildings sprang up in every city,
and the population rapidly increased. All announced
a new era of regeneration in Castile. Contemporary
writers, struck by these prodigies, exalt with one voice
this glorious reign which opens new destinies to
Spain.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It is certain that in no other country in Europe
at this date were the laws so well maintained and the
rights of the individual so well protected. Justice
was rigorously done, there were no longer arbitrary
imprisonments and sequestrations, whilst the unequal
and capricious taxation of the past was abolished for
all time.</p>

<p>“Such,” says Marin&aelig;us, “was the strict justice
meted out to each in this happy reign that all men,
nobles and knights, traders and husbandmen, rich and
poor, masters and servants, were treated alike and
received equally their share of it.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Where so much was good, where so much stout
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
service was done to the cause of progress and civilization,
it is the more deplorable to find in this reign the
one evil thing that is now to be considered&mdash;so evil
that it must be held to counterbalance and stultify all
the excellences of Isabella’s sway.</p>

<p>The particular praise which so far we have heard
their contemporaries bestowing upon the Catholic
Sovereigns, is a praise which every man in every age
must echo.</p>

<p>But there was praise as loud upon another score,
as universally uttered by every contemporary and many
subsequent historians, some no doubt because they
were sincere in the deadly bigotry that inspired it,
others because they did not dare to express themselves
in different terms.</p>

<p>“By her,” cries Bernaldez, as a climax to his
summing-up of her many virtues and wise provisions,
“was burnt and destroyed the most evil and abominable
Mosaic, Talmudic, Jewish heresy.”</p>

<p>And Mariana, the historian, accounts the introduction
of the Inquisition into Spain the most glorious
feature of the reign of Ferdinand and Isabella. He
is setting it above all the moral splendours of that day
when he exclaims:</p>

<p>“Still better and happier fortune for Spain was the
establishment in Castile at about this time of a new
and holy tribunal of severe and grave judges for the
purpose of inquiring into and punishing heretical
pravity and apostasy....”<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a></p>

<p>It would be unjust to suppose that there is a
man to be found to-day in the Church of Rome, of
which the Spanish Inquisition was a deplorable and
integral part, who can turn with us in other than regret
to consider this black shadow that lies across one of
the brightest pages of history.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V<br />

<span class="medium">THE JEWS IN SPAIN</span></h2>

<p>You have seen the Catholic Sovereigns instilling order
into that distracted land of Spain, enforcing submissiveness
to the law, instituting a system of police for the
repression of brigandage, curtailing the depredations
of the nobles, checking the abuses and usurpations of
the clergy, restoring public credit, and generally quelling
all the elements of unrest that had afflicted the
State.</p>

<p>But one gravely disturbing element still remained
in the bitter rancour prevailing between Christian
and Jew.</p>

<p>“Some clerics and many laymen,” says Pulgar,<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a>
“informed the Sovereigns that there were in the Kingdom
many Christians of Jewish extraction who were
Judaizing<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a> again and holding Jewish rites in their
houses, and who neither believed the Catholic Faith
nor performed the Catholic duties. They implored
the Sovereigns, as they were Christian princes, to
punish that detestable error, because if left unpunished
it might so spread that our Holy Catholic Faith must
receive great harm.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Exactly to realize the position at the time, and
the force behind the arguments employed to induce
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
the Catholic Sovereigns to complete the ordering of
the kingdom by the repression of the re-Judaizing, or
apostasy, of the New-Christians&mdash;as the baptized Jews
and their descendants were termed&mdash;it is necessary
to take at least a brief retrospective survey of the
history of the Israelites in Spain.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At what period the Jews first appeared in the
peninsula it is not easy to determine with accuracy.</p>

<p>Salazar de Mendoza and other ancient historians,
who base their writings upon the work of Tom&aacute;s
Tamayo de Vargas, put forward views upon this
subject that are curious rather than important.</p>

<p>They assert that the Kingdom of Spain was
founded by Tubal, the son of Japhet, who had Europe
for his portion when the division was made among the
sons of Noah. Hence it was called Tubalia, and later
on Sepharad by the Jews, and Hesperida by the
Greeks. They hold that the first Jews in the Iberian
Peninsula were probably those who came with Nebuchadnezzar
II, King of Chaldea, and that he brought
with him, in addition to Chaldeans and Persians, ten
tribes of Israel, who peopled Toledo,<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a> and built there
the most beautiful synagogue that had been theirs
since the temple of Solomon. This synagogue,
Mendoza states, afterwards became the Convent of
Santa Maria la Blanca (a statement which the architecture
of Santa Maria la Blanca very flatly contradicts).
He further informs us that they built another synagogue
at Zamora, and that those who worshipped
there always prided themselves&mdash;his point of view,
of course, is narrowly Christian&mdash;that to them had
been addressed St. Paul’s Epistle to the Hebrews.</p>

<p>They founded a university at Lucena (near
Cordova), and schools where the law was taught,
so that the holy Jewish religion spread rapidly, and
was observed throughout Spain until the coming of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
Our Lord into the world. Then, in 37 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>, the
Apostle St. James came to preach the new gospel
in Iberia, “so that Spain was the first land after
Judea to receive the holy law of grace.” Following
the writings of Vargas, he goes so far as to say:
“and although to many it has seemed apocryphal
that the Toledo Jews wrote to denounce the Passion
of Our Lord, the assertion is not without good
foundation.”<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a></p>

<p>Amador de los Rios is probably correct in his
opinion that the Jews made their first appearance
in Spain during the Visigothic dominion, after the
fall of Jerusalem; and scarcely had they settled in
the peninsula when they began to experience the
bitterness of persecution. But after they had been
delivered from this by the Saracen invaders, to whom
by race and creed they were fairly sympathetic, they
enjoyed&mdash;alike under Moslem and Christian rule&mdash;a
season of prosperity in Spain, which endured until
the close of the thirteenth century. And this notwithstanding
the undercurrent of mutual contempt and
hatred, of Christian for Jew and Jew for Christian,
that was invincible in an age of strong religious feeling.</p>

<p>To the Christian every Jew he encountered was
his natural and hereditary enemy, a descendant of
those who had crucified the Saviour; therefore he was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
an object of execration, a man upon whom it must
be meritorious to avenge the world’s greatest crime
which had been perpetrated by his forbears.</p>

<p>The Jew, on the other hand, held the Christian in
a contempt as thorough. From the standpoint of his
own pure and unadulterated monotheism, he looked
scornfully upon a religion that must appear to him no
better than an adaptation of polytheism, developed
upon the doctrines of one whom the Jews had rejected
as an impostor who had attempted to usurp the place
of the promised Messiah. To the truly devout Jew
of those days the Christian religion can have been
little better than a blasphemy. Nor was that the only
source of his contempt. Looking back upon his own
splendid ancestry, upon the antiquity of his race
and the high order of its culture&mdash;the fruit of
centuries of intellectual evolution&mdash;what but scorn
could he entertain for these Spaniards of yesterday’s
hatching, who were just emerging from the slough
of barbarism?</p>

<p>It is clear that mutual esteem between the races
was out of all question in an age of strong religious
prejudices. Toleration, however, was possible, and
the Jew applied himself to win it. To this end he
employed at once the vices and the virtues of the
unfortunate, which centuries of tribulation had rendered
inherent in him.</p>

<p>Armed with a stoicism that was almost pitiful, he
donned a mask of indifference to confront expressed
hatred and contempt; to violence he opposed cunning
and the long-suffering patience that is so peculiarly
his own&mdash;the patience that is allied with a high order
of intelligence; the patience which, interpreted into
“an infinite capacity for taking pains,” has been
urged as the definition of genius, and is the secret
of the Jew’s success wherever he is established.</p>

<p>In the cohesion in a foreign land of this people
that cannot keep together as a nation, and in their
extraordinary commercial acuteness, lies the strength
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
of the Jews. They grew wealthy by their industry
and thrift, until they were in a position to purchase
those privileges which in Christendom are the birth-right
of every Christian. Their numbers, too, made
it difficult in Spain to treat them with contumely; for
upon the reasoned estimate of Amador de los Rios<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a>
there were close upon a million Jews in Castile at the
end of the thirteenth century.</p>

<p>They formed by their solidarity&mdash;as they always
do&mdash;an <i>imperium in imperio</i>, a state of their own
within the state; they had their own language and
customs; they were governed by their own laws,
which were enforced by their Rabbis and chiefs, and
they pursued their own religion unmolested, for even
the observation of the Sabbath was respected by the
Castilians. Thus they came to create for themselves
in a foreign country a simulacrum of their own
native land.</p>

<p>It is true that they were afflicted from time to time
by sporadic, local persecutions; but in the main they
enjoyed a tolerance and religious liberty which the
poor harried Albigenses beyond the Pyrenees might
well have envied. For the Church, which had already
established the Inquisition, was very far&mdash;for reasons
that shall be considered in the next chapter&mdash;from
instigating any persecution of the Children of Israel.
Thus, Honorius III, whilst carrying forward the
policy of Innocent III, and enjoining the extirpation
of heretics in Southern France and elsewhere, confirmed
(November 7, 1217) the privileges accorded to
the Jews by his predecessors upon the throne of St.
Peter. These were that no Jew should be constrained
to receive baptism; that should he incline to embrace
the Christian Faith he must be received in it with
love and benevolence; that his feasts and religious
ceremonies must be respected by Christians; that
the whipping or stoning of Jews be forbidden and
punished; that their burial-places be held sacred.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span></p>

<p>And when King Ferdinand III&mdash;afterwards
canonized&mdash;wrested Seville from the Moors (1224), he
made over one of the best districts of the city to the
Jews, and gave them the four mosques contained in it
that they might convert them into synagogues.</p>

<p>The only restraint placed upon them by the law
was that they must refrain, under pain of death, from
attempting to proselytize among Christians, and that
they must show respect for the Christian religion.</p>

<p>These were the halcyon days of Hebrew prosperity
in Spain. Their distinguished abilities were recognized,
and they won to many positions of importance
in the government. The finances of the kingdom
were in their control, and Castile prospered under
their able administration of its commerce. Alfonso VIII,
in whose reign it is estimated there were 12,000 Jews
in Toledo alone, employed a Jew as his treasurer, and
did not disdain to take a Jewess for his mistress&mdash;an
interesting little fact in view of the law that was so
soon to be promulgated on that subject.</p>

<p>Hardly less than their value to the nation’s commerce
were their services to science, art, and literature.
They excelled particularly in medicine and chemistry,
and the most skilful doctors and surgeons of the
Middle Ages were men of their race.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the middle of the thirteenth century a change
unfortunately set in, and this external harmony so
laboriously established was disturbed by an excrescence
of the real feelings that had never ceased to underlie
it. Largely the Jews were themselves to blame.
Deluded by the religious liberty that was conceded
them, by the dignities to which men of their faith
had climbed, and by the prosperity which they had
attained, they failed to perceive that their accumulated
wealth was in itself a menace to their safety.</p>

<p>Emboldened by the consideration shown them,
they committed the imprudence of giving a free rein
to their Oriental taste for splendour; they surrounded
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
themselves with luxury, and permitted themselves an
ostentatious magnificence in their raiment and equipages,
and thus proclaimed the wealth they had
been amassing through generations of comparative
obscurity.</p>

<p>Had they confined themselves to this strictly personal
display all might yet have been well. But being
dressed and housed in princely fashion, they put on
princely ways. They grew haughty and arrogant with
the horrible arrogance of wealth. They allowed their
disdain of the less affluent Christians to transpire in
their contemptuous bearing towards them, and being
unchecked in this it was but another step to abuse the
privileges which they enjoyed.</p>

<p>Their parade of wealth had provoked envy&mdash;the
most dangerous and maleficent of the passions implanted
in the human heart. Their arrogance and cavalier
bearing stirred that envy into activity.</p>

<p>Questions arose touching the sources of their
wealth. It was propounded against them that their
usurious practices had ruined many of the Christians
whom they now dared to spurn. And although usury
had been sanctioned and it had been proclaimed lawful
for them to charge a rate of interest as high as 40 per
centum, it was suddenly remembered that usury had in
all times been uncompromisingly condemned by the
Church&mdash;and by the term usury the Church then
understood any interest, however slight, paid upon
borrowed money.</p>

<p>Fanaticism began to stir uneasily in its slumber,
and presently, under the spur of greed, it roused itself
and reared its horrid head. Public feeling against
the Israelites was increased by the fact that they had
practically acquired control of the ever-unpopular
offices for the collection of taxes.</p>

<p>The populace grew menacing. Evil tales concerning
them were put about, and they were accused,
among other ritual abominations, of practising human
sacrifices.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span></p>

<p>Whether there was any real ground for the accusation
is one of those historical mysteries that baffle the
student. On the one hand it seems impossible to
collect sufficient data to establish any single one of the
many specific accusations made; whilst on the other
hand, in view of the persistence with which the charge
crops up in different countries and at different epochs,<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a>
it would be presumptuous to dismiss it as groundless.</p>

<p>The first official recognition of the accusation is to
be found in the code known as the <i>Partidas</i>, promulgated
by Alfonso XI (1256-1263), which contains the
following clause:</p>

<p>“As we hear that in some places the Jews on Good
Friday make a mocking commemoration of the Passion
of Our Lord Jesus Christ, stealing boys and crucifying
them, or making waxen images and crucifying these
when boys are not procurable, we order that should it
become known that hereafter, in any part of our realm,
such a thing is done, all those whom it is ascertained
are connected with the deed shall be arrested and
brought before the King. And when he shall have
satisfied himself of the truth of the charge he shall have
them put to death, as many as they may be.”<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Llorente mentions four specific cases of ritual
murder, to which he appears to attach credit:</p>

<p>1250.&mdash;A choir-boy of the Metropolitan Church of
Zaragoza, named Domingo de Val, crucified by Jews.
He was afterwards canonized and worshipped at
Zaragoza as a martyr.</p>

<p>1452.&mdash;A boy crucified by Jews at Valladolid.</p>

<p>1454.&mdash;A boy from the lordship of the Marquess
of Almarza, near Zamora, crucified. His heart was
afterwards burnt and the ashes were consumed in wine
by the Jews who attended the ceremony. The body
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
was afterwards discovered by a dog, and this led to
the arrest of the culprits and their conviction.</p>

<p>1468.&mdash;At Sepulveda, in the Bishopric of Segovia,
a boy was taken on the Thursday of Holy Week, and
on Good Friday he was crowned with thorns, whipped,
and finally crucified. The Bishop, D. Juan Arias,
having received intelligence of this crime, instituted
an inquiry which resulted in the arrest of several men,
who, being convicted, were put to death.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Llorente gives as his authority for the third and
fourth cases the “Fortalicium Fidei” of Espina&mdash;by
no means an authority to be unquestioningly accepted.
For the second he mentions no authority whatever;
whilst for fuller information upon the first he refers
his readers to the “Historia de Santo Domingo de
Val,” which is of no more authority than most works
of this class.<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a> But the canonization of this victim
gives rise to thought; for it was never the way of the
Church of Rome to proceed recklessly and without due
evidence in such matters. Even if it were, however,
it would be necessary in this case to show a motive for
such recklessness. The only motive possible would
be the desire to create justification for a persecution
of the Jews. But, as has been said&mdash;and as shall
presently be made abundantly clear&mdash;it never was
the aim of the Church of Rome to engage in such
persecution or to incite to it.</p>

<p>The famous case of the crucifixion of the “Holy
Infant” of La Gardia, whose trial was directed by
Torquemada himself, shall be considered in its proper
place.</p>

<p>As is well known, the practice of human sacrifice is
an extremely old one; and it has been associated in
varying forms with many widely different cults. The
earliest absolutely historical instance of Jews resorting
to it is probably that quoted by Dr. J. G. Frazer
(in “The Golden Bough”) from the “Historia
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
Ecclesiastica” of Socrates. The scholiast relates
how in 416, at Imnestar in Syria, a company of Jews
during one of their festivals fell to deriding Christians
and their Christ. At the height of their frenzy they
seized a boy, bound him to a cross, and hung him up.
A brawl was the result, and the authorities intervened
to make the Jews pay dearly for their crime.</p>

<p>Amador de los Rios, in dealing with the spread
of this charge against the Spanish Hebrews in the
thirteenth century, attributes it to the subject’s having
been made the theme of an exceedingly dramatic
narrative poem in the “Milagros de Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora”
by Gonzalo de Berceo. At the same time he does
not go so far as to urge that the story upon which the
ballad was founded may not have had its roots in fact.
On the contrary, he suggests that such may have been
the case, and having chronicled the persistence of the
accusation, he refrains from expressing any definite
opinion on the subject, hesitating either to accept, or
to dismiss as idle calumnies, these charges of ritual
murder.</p>

<p>From the able arguments that have been put
forward on this same subject by Frazer and Wendland,
it is to be concluded that in any case the
Christians were mistaken in assuming that these
alleged crucifixions held at the Feast of Purim&mdash;whether
of human beings or of effigies&mdash;were intended
as a mockery of the Passion of the Redeemer.
Their origin is a far more ancient one, involving a
rite of which the Sacrifice of Golgotha may itself have
been an individual celebration&mdash;the commemoration
of the hanging of Haman&mdash;which, again, was the
continuation of a ritual practised by the Babylonians
and acquired from them by the Jews during their
captivity.<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a></p>

</div>

<p>Whatever may be the truth of this matter of ritual
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
murder, there is no doubt that these rumours were
diligently spread to inflame the popular mind against
the Jews.</p>

<p>Fanatical monks&mdash;ignoring the papal injunctions
of forbearance and toleration towards the Children of
Israel&mdash;went forth through Castile preaching the iniquity
of the Jews and God’s wrath to fall upon the land that
harboured them. Thus incited, and perceiving profit
in the business, the faithful rose to destroy them.
Massacres and pillages were the inevitable result,
although as a rule the authorities were prompt to intervene
and repress the populace’s combined fanaticism
and quest for plunder.</p>

<p>But when in 1342 the Black Death spread over
Europe, the Dominicans and others renewed their
denunciations, and led men to believe the Jews
responsible for the pestilence that afflicted the land.
In Germany they were ruthlessly given to choose
between death and baptism, and they suffered horribly
until Pope Clement VI stepped in to save them. He
besought the Emperor to restrain his murderers; and
finding that his pleadings lacked effect, he launched
the thunderbolts of excommunication against all who
should continue to engage in the persecution of the
Jews.</p>

<p>Stricken with terror before that awful menace of
the Church, the faithful paused in the carnage, and
the voice of denunciation fell silent.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Thus, for a season, they won a little measure of
peace. But throughout the fourteenth century spurts
of persecution broke out here and there, and massacres
took place in Castile, Aragon, and Navarre. The
authorities, too, with the precedent of the Partidas
before them, whilst not going the length of sanctioning,
or even permitting violence where they could repress
it, yet practised upon the Jews the most flagrant and
cruel injustices. Of these the worst instance is that
of the tax of 20,000 gold dobles levied upon the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
aljamas of Toledo by Henry II on his accession in
1369. To realize this sum he ordered the public sale
not only of the property of the Jews, but actually
of their persons into slavery, as is to be seen by his
decree.<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a></p>

<p>The persecutions with which they were visited
were chiefly procured by the monks, who went abroad
preaching against them, fomenting the hatred of the
Christians against a people who were largely their
creditors. Even where the religious incentive was
insufficient, the easy way of wiping out debts which
this gratification of their piety afforded proved irresistible
to a people whose flagrant immorality&mdash;in
every sense of the term&mdash;went hand in hand with
their perfervid devoutness.</p>

<p>These persecutions, as we have said, the authorities
made haste to quell. But there arose presently a
rabid fanatic who proved altogether irrepressible.
His name was Hernando Martinez. He was a
Dominican friar, and Canon of Ecija. Of his sincerity
there can be no doubt; and their sincerity is the
most terrible thing about such men, blinding them
to the point of utter madness. He was ready to suffer
any martyrdom sooner than be silent in a cause in
which he considered it his sacred duty to give tongue.
About this sacred duty he went forth, screaming his
denunciations of the Jews, frenziedly inciting the mob
to rise up and destroy this accursed race, these enemies
of God, these crucifiers of the Saviour. Indeed, he
could not have shown a more fierce and frothing hatred
of them had they been the very men who at the throne
of Pilate had clamoured for the blood of Christ&mdash;and
for whose pardon the gentle Redeemer had prayed
in His expiring moments: a matter this which escaped
the attention of the Archdeacon of Ecija, being&mdash;like
many another&mdash;too full of piety to find room for
Christianity in his soul.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span></p>

<p>Appeals against him were made to the Archbishop
of Seville, whose official, or representative, he was.
He was ordered by his Archbishop to desist, and when
in flagrant disobedience to his superior he continued to
preach his gospel of blood and hatred, appeals were
made to the King, and even to the Pope; and by
King and Pope was he commanded to cease his
inflammatory sermons.</p>

<p>But he defied them all alike. In his fanatical fury
he carried his contumacy so far as to call in question
the papal authority, and to declare illicit the sanction
given by the popes for the erection and preservation
of synagogues. This was perilously akin to heresy.
Men had been sent to the stake for less, and Hernando
Martinez must have been utterly mad if he conceived
that the Church would permit him to continue the
diffusion of such doctrines.</p>

<p>He was brought before the episcopal court to
answer for his words. He answered defiantly&mdash;told
them that the breath of God was in him, and that it
was not for men to stop his mouth.</p>

<p>Thereupon Don Pedro Barroso&mdash;the archbishop&mdash;ordered
that he should stand his trial for contumacy
and heresy, and meanwhile suspended him from all
jurisdiction and all duties as archiepiscopal official.</p>

<p>It happened, however, that Barroso died shortly
thereafter, before the trial could take place; and
Martinez contrived to get himself elected by the
Chapter to the position of one of the provisors of the
diocese pending the appointment of a successor to
Barroso. Thus he resumed his power and the faculty
to preach; and he used it so ruthlessly that in December
of 1390 several synagogues in Seville were
laid in ruins by the mob acting in obedience to his
incitement.</p>

<p>The Jews appealed to the King for protection, and
the authorities, now thoroughly roused, ordered that
Martinez be deposed from his office and forbidden to
preach, and that the demolished synagogues be rebuilt
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
by the Chapter which had made itself responsible by
electing him.</p>

<p>But Martinez, ever defiant, disregarded both King
and Chapter. He pursued his bloodthirsty mission,
stirring up a populace that was but too ready to perceive&mdash;through
his arguments&mdash;a way to perform an
act that must be pleasing to God whilst enriching
itself at the same time. What populace could have
been proof against such reasoning?</p>

<p>Finally, in the summer of 1391, the whole country
was ablaze with fanatical persecution. The fierce
flames broke out first in Seville, under the assiduous
fanning of the deposed archdeacon.</p>

<p>Three years before, in view of the harm that it
was urged the Jews were doing to religion by their
free intermingling with Christians, King John I had
ordered them to live apart in districts appointed for
them, which came to be known as Juderias (Jewries
or ghettos). It was commanded that the Christians
should not enter these, and that for purposes of trade
the Jews should come to the public markets and there
erect tents, but they must own no house or domicile
beyond the precincts of the Juderias, and they must
withdraw to these at nightfall.</p>

<p>Into the Juderia of Seville the mob now penetrated,
wrought by Martinez to a pitch of frenzy almost
equal to his own. They went armed, and they put
the place to sack and slaughter, butchering its every
tenant without discrimination or pity for age or sex.
The number of the slain has been estimated at some
four thousand, men, women, and children.<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a></p>

<p>From Seville the conflagration spread to the other
cities of Spain, and what had happened there happened
in Burgos, Valencia, Toledo, and Cordova, and further
in Aragon, Cataluna, and Navarre, whilst the streets
of Barcelona are said to have run with the blood of
immolated Jews.</p>

<p>Into the Jewry of every town went the infuriated
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
mob to force Christ&mdash;as these Christians understood
Him&mdash;upon the inhabitants; to offer the terror-stricken
Jews the choice between steel and water&mdash;death
and baptism.</p>

<p>So mighty and violent was the outbreak that the
authorities were powerless to quell it, and where they
attempted to do so with any degree of determination
they were themselves caught in the fury of the
populace. Nor did the slaughter cease until the
Christians were glutted, and some fifty thousand Jews
had perished.</p>

<p>The churches were now filled with Jews who
came clamouring for baptism, having perceived that
through its waters lay the way to temporal as well as
to spiritual life, and having in most cases&mdash;in the
abject state of terror to which they had been reduced&mdash;more
concern for the former than for the latter.
Llorente estimates the number of baptized at over a
million, and this number was considerably swelled by
the conversions effected by St. Vincent Ferrer, who
came forth upon his mission to the Jews in the early
years of the fifteenth century, and who induced
thousands to enter the fold of Christianity by his
eloquence and by the marvels which it is said he
wrought.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The fury of the mob having spent itself, peace
was gradually restored, and little by little those Jews
who had remained faithful to their religion and yet
survived began to come forth from their hiding-places,
to assemble, and, with the amazing, invincible patience
and pertinacity of their race, to build up once more
the edifice that had been demolished.</p>

<p>But if the sword of persecution was sheathed, the
spirit that had guided it was still abroad, and the Jews
were made to experience further repressive measures.
Under decrees of 1412-13 they lost most of the few
privileges that the late king had left them.</p>

<p>It was ordained by these that henceforth no
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
Jew should occupy the position of a judge even in a
Hebrew court, nor should any Jew be permitted to
bear witness. All synagogues were to be closed or
converted into Christian temples, with the exception
of one in every town in which Jews should be
established. They were forbidden to continue the
practice of the professions of medicine, surgery, and
chemistry, in which they had specialised with such
good results to the community. They were no longer
to occupy the offices of tax-collectors, and all commerce
with Christians was forbidden them. They
must neither buy nor sell in trade with Christians, nor
eat with them, nor use their baths, nor send their
children to the same schools. The ghetto was ordered
to be walled round, so as to be enclosed and cut off
from the rest of the city, and they were forbidden
to issue from it. Intercourse between a Jew and a
Christian woman was forbidden under pain of death
by burning, even though the woman were a prostitute.
They were forbidden to shave, and compelled to
allow their beards and hair to grow, in addition to
which they were ordered to wear as a distinguishing
mark a circle of red cloth upon the shoulder of their
gabardines. They were further compelled to hear
three sermons annually from a Christian preacher,
whose aim it was to pour abuse and contumely upon
them, to inveigh against their accursed race and creed,
to assure them of the certainty of the damnation that
awaited them, and to exalt before them the excellences
of the Catholic religion (based, be it remembered, that
we may fully savour the irony, upon Faith, Hope, and
Charity).<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a></p>

<p>When King John I had established the Juderias
in 1388, curtailing at the same time the privileges
which until then the Jews had enjoyed&mdash;at least by
paying for them&mdash;there had been many who, finding
the restraint imposed upon them altogether intolerable,
had abandoned the faith of their fathers and embraced
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
Christianity. Those who held the affairs of this
world in esteem had sought baptism, and whilst many
in doing so had entirely broken with the past&mdash;and
often, as is the way of converts, become zealots in
their observance of the faith embraced&mdash;many others,
whilst outwardly complying with the obligations of the
Christian religion, continued in secret to observe the
law of Moses and their Jewish rites. Similarly these
further decrees against their liberty had the effect of
causing still more numerous conversions to Christianity.</p>

<p>These converts were termed “New-Christians”
by the Spaniards. By those of their own race who
had remained faithful they were called “marranos”&mdash;a
contemptuous epithet derived from <i>Maran-atha</i>,
(“The Lord is coming”), but supposed by the
Christians to signify “accursed.” It came into general
use before very long.</p>

<p>These New-Christians, as a consequence of their
conversion, gained not merely the privileges recently
lost to them as Jews, but found themselves upon a
footing of absolute equality with the Old-Christians;
every profession was open to them, and by applying
themselves to these with all their energy and intelligence,
they found themselves before very long in
possession of some of the highest offices in the land.</p>

<p>But in the meanwhile the rigour of the decrees
of 1412 came to be considerably relaxed; a degree
of liberty and of intermingling with Christians was
permitted to the Jews, and many of the offices which
they had occupied of old came once more under their
control, chiefly those concerned with commerce and
finance and the farming of the taxes. Under the
deplorable rule of Henry IV the nobles, whose slave
he was, demanded that he should “expel from his
service and States the Jews who, exploiting public
misery, have contrived to return to the appointments
of tax-gatherers.”</p>

<p>The weak King agreed, but neglected to execute
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
his promise; it was presently forgotten, and the
Jewish section of the community was allowed to
continue under the conditions of ease we have
described. Under these conditions was it found by
Ferdinand and Isabella upon their accession, nor does
it appear that they paid any particular attention to it
until invited to do so by the “clerics and laymen”
who, as Pulgar<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a> tells us, represented to them that in
the re-Judaizings that were taking place was matter for
their jurisdiction.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI<br />

<span class="medium">THE NEW-CHRISTIANS</span></h2>

<p>It must clearly be understood that so far the Inquisition,
which for some three centuries already had been
very active in Italy and Southern France, had not
reached Castile.</p>

<p>Even as recently as 1474, when Pope Sixtus IV
had ordered the Dominicans to set up the Inquisition
in Spain, and whilst in obedience to that command
inquisitors were appointed in Aragon, Valencia, Catalu&ntilde;a,
and Navarre, it was not held necessary to make any
appointment in Castile, where no heresy of any account
could be perceived. Trials of such offences against
the Faith as might occur were conducted by the bishops,
who were fully empowered to deal with them; and
such offences being rare, the necessity for a special
tribunal did not suggest itself, nor did the Pope press
the matter, desirous though he might be to see the
Inquisition universally established.</p>

<p>There was, of course, a large Hebrew population,
and also a considerable number of Moslems, in the
peninsula. But these did not come within the jurisdiction
of any ecclesiastical court. The Inquisition
itself could take no cognizance of them, as they did not
offend against the Faith.</p>

<p>Explanation is perhaps necessary. We touch here
upon a point on which the religious persecution known
as the Inquisition compares favourably with any other
religious persecution in history, and in common justice
this point should not&mdash;as but too frequently has been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
the case&mdash;be obscured. There is too little to be urged
in favour of this tribunal so terribly inequitable in its
practices that we can afford to slur over the one feature
of its constitution that is invested with a degree of
equity.</p>

<p>Whatever may have been the case in the course of
civil and popular persecutions, whatever may have been
done by a frenzied populace at the instigation of odd
fanatical preachers acting without the authority of their
superiors in giving rein to the fierce bigotry they had
nurtured in their souls, the Church herself, it must be
clearly understood, neither urged nor sanctioned the
persecution of those born into any religion that was
not in itself a heresy of the Roman Faith. The tribunal
of the Inquisition was established solely&mdash;and moved
solely&mdash;to deal with those who apostatized or seceded
from the ranks of the Roman Church, precisely as an
army deals with deserting soldiers. Fanatical, horribly
narrow, cruelly bigoted as was the spirit of the Inquisition,
yet the inquisitors confined their prosecutions to
apostates, to the adulterers of a faith whose purity and
incorruptibility they had made it their mission to
maintain.</p>

<p>If the Church repressed liberty of conscience, if she
stifled rationalism and crushed independence of thought,
she did so only where her own children were concerned&mdash;those
who had been born into the Catholic Faith or
who had embraced it in conversion. With those born
into any other independent religion she had no concern.
To Jew, Moslem, Buddhist, and Pagan, and to the
savages of the New World, when it came presently
to be discovered, she accorded the fullest religious
freedom.</p>

<p>To appreciate this, it is but necessary to consider
such enactments as those of Honorius III for the
protection of the Jews, of Clement VI, who threatened
their persecutors with excommunication, and the action
of Pope and Archbishop in the case of the inflammatory
sermons of Hernando Martinez. It is sufficient
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
to consider that when the Jews were driven out of
Spain&mdash;as shall presently be seen&mdash;they actually found
a refuge in Rome itself, and were received with kindliness
by Pope Alexander VI (Roderigo Borgia), which
in itself is one of the oddest ironies that ecclesiastical
history can offer.</p>

<p>And if this is not sufficient, let us for a moment
consider the immunity and comparative peace enjoyed
by the Jews who dwelt in Rome itself, in their district
of Trastevere.</p>

<p>They were a recognized section of the community
in the Papal City. On his coronation procession each
Pope would pause near the Campo de’Fiori to receive
the company of Jews that came, headed by the Rabbi,
to pay homage to their sovereign&mdash;precisely as their
ancestors had come to pay homage to the emperor.</p>

<p>To the Vicar of Christ the Rabbi would now
proffer the rolls of the Pentateuch, swathed in a cloth.
The Pope would take them into his hands, to show
that he respected the law contained in them, and
would then put them behind him, to signify that this
law now belonged to the past. From behind the
Pontiff the Rabbi would receive back his sacred
scriptures, and depart with his escort, usually accompanied
by the jeers, insults, and vituperations of the
Roman populace.<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a></p>

<p>It will be understood, then, that the Inquisition’s
establishment in Spain was not urged for the purpose
of persecuting the Jews. It had no concern with
Jews, if we confine the term purely to its religious
meaning, signifying the observers of the law of Moses.
Its concern was entirely with the apostasy of those who,
although of the Jewish race, had become Christians by
conversion. By the subsequent secret re-Judaizings,
or return of these New-Christians to the religion of
their fathers (which they had abandoned out of
material considerations), they came within the jurisdiction
of the Inquisition, and rendered themselves liable
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
to prosecution as heretics, a prosecution which could
never have overtaken them had they but continued in
their original faith.</p>

<p>There is no denying that many of those who had
been baptized against their will, as the only means of
saving their lives when the fury of the Christian mob
was unleashed against them, had remained Jews at
heart, had continued in secret to practise the Jewish
rites, and were exerting themselves to bring back to
the fold of Israel their apostate brethren. Others,
however, upon receiving baptism may have determined
to keep the law to which they now pledged themselves
and to persevere honestly in Christianity. Yet
many of the old Jewish observances were become
habitual with them: the trained&mdash;almost the hereditary&mdash;repugnance
to certain meats, the observance of
certain feast days, and several minor domestic laws
that are part of the Jewish code, were too deeply
implanted in them to be plucked up by the roots
at the first attempt. Time was required in which they
could settle into Christian habits; two or three generations
might be necessary in some families before these
habits came to be perfectly acquired and the old ones
to be entirely obliterated. Had those who urged the
Sovereigns to introduce the Inquisition into Castile,
or had the Sovereigns themselves but perceived this
and exercised the necessary and reasonable patience
in the matter, Spain might have been spared the
horrors that took root in her soil and sapped the
vigour and intellectual energy of her children, so that
in her case decadence pressed swift and close upon
the very heels of supreme achievement.</p>

<p>Execrable as is the memory of the Inquisition to
all the world, to none should be it so execrable as
to Spain, since the evil that it wrought recoiled entirely
upon herself.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was on the occasion of Isabella’s first visit to
Seville&mdash;that punitive visit already mentioned&mdash;that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
the establishment of the Holy Office in Spain was
first proposed to her. The King was at the time
in Estremadura upon the business of fortifying his
frontiers against Portugal.</p>

<p>The proposal came from Alonso de Ojeda, the
Prior of the Dominicans of Seville, a man who
enjoyed great credit and was reputed saintly (“vir
pius ac sanctus,” Paramo calls him).</p>

<p>Seeing her zeal to put down lawlessness and to
purify and restore order to the country, Ojeda urged
upon her notice the spread of the detestable Judaizing
movement that was toward. He laid stress upon the
hypocrisy that had underlain so many of the conversions
of the Jews. He pointed out&mdash;with some
degree of justice&mdash;that these men had made a mock
of the Holy Church, had defiled her sacraments, and
had perpetrated the most abominable sacrilege by their
pretended acceptance of the Christian faith. He
urged that not only must this be punished, but that
the havoc which these Judaizers were working among
the more faithful New-Christians, and the proselytizing
which they went so far as to attempt among Old-Christians,
must be checked.</p>

<p>To carry out this urgently-required purification, he
implored the Queen to establish the Inquisition.<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a></p>

<p>There was a speciousness, and even a justice, in
his arguments which must have impressed that pious
lady. But her piety, intense as it was, did not carry
her to the lengths required of her by her priestly
counsellor. The balance of her splendid mind was
singularly true. She perceived that here was matter
that called for a remedy; but she perceived also the
fanaticism inspiring the friar who stood before her,
and realized how his fanaticism must exaggerate the
evil.</p>

<p>She was aware also of the extreme malevolence of
which the New-Christians were the object. By their
conversion they might have deflected the religious
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
hostility of the Castilians; but the more deeply-rooted
racial antagonism remained. It not only remained,
but it was quickened by the envy which these New-Christians
were exciting. The energy and intelligence
inherent in men of their race were serving them now, as
they had served them before, to their undoing. There
were no offices of eminence in which New-Christians
were not to be found; there were none in which they
did not outnumber the Old-Christians&mdash;the pure-blooded
Castilians.</p>

<p>This the Queen knew, for she was herself surrounded
by converts and the descendants of converts.
Several of her counsellors, her three secretaries&mdash;one
of whom was that chronicler, Pulgar, whose record of
the situation has been quoted&mdash;and her very treasurer
were all New-Christians.<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a></p>

<p>These men Isabella knew intimately, and esteemed.
Judging the New-Christians generally by those in her
immediate service, she was naturally led to discount
Ojeda’s imputations against them. She perceived the
source of these imputations, and she must have taken
into consideration the ineradicable bitterness of the
popular feeling against Jews and the intensity of a
prejudice which extended&mdash;as we have said&mdash;to the
New-Christians to such an extent that they continued
to be known as “Judios,” notwithstanding their conversion,
so that often in contemporary chronicles it is
difficult to determine to which class the writer is
referring.</p>

<p>We have said that, in spite of conversions, the
racial hostility remained. The Christian attitude
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
towards the Hebrew had not changed in the hundred
years that were sped since, under the incitings of the
Archdeacon of Ecija, the mob had risen up and
massacred them. They were the descendants of the
crucifiers always.</p>

<p>A vestige of this feeling lingers to this day in the
peninsula. In the vocabulary of the Portuguese
lower orders, and even of the indifferently educated,
there is no such word as “cruel.” “Jew” is the
term that has entirely usurped its functions, and as an
injunction against cruelty to man or beast, “Don’t be
a Jew!” (<i>N&atilde;o seja judeu!</i>) is still the only phrase.</p>

<p>No conception of what was the popular feeling at
the time can be conveyed more adequately than by a
translation of the passage from Bernaldez concerning
the manners and customs of the Jews. Bernaldez
was a priest, and therefore, to some extent, an
educated man&mdash;as in the main his history bears
witness&mdash;yet a piece of writing so ludicrously stupid
and detestably malicious as this passage can only have
emanated from a mind in which bigotry had destroyed
all sense of proportion.</p>

<p>The only historical value of the passage lies in the
deplorable fact that undoubtedly it may be accepted
as a faithful mirror of the prejudice that existed in
Isabella’s day.</p>

<p>It runs:</p>

<p>“Just as heretics and Jews have always fled from
Christian doctrines, so they have always fled from
Christian customs. They are great drinkers and
gluttons, who never lose the Jewish habit of eating
garbage of onions and garlic fried in oil, and of meat
stewed in oil, which they use instead of lard; and oil
with meat is a thing that smells very badly, so that
their houses and doorways stink vilely of that garbage;
and they have the peculiar smell of Jews in consequence
of their food and of the fact that they are not
baptized. And although some have been baptized,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
yet the virtue of the baptism having been annulled by
their credulity [<i>i.e.</i> their adherence to their own faith]
and by their Judaizing, they stink like Jews. They
will not eat pork save under compulsion. They eat
meat in Lent and on the eve of feast days.... They
keep the Passover and the Sabbath as best they
can. They send oil to the synagogues for the lamps.
Jews come to preach to them in their houses secretly&mdash;especially
to the women, very secretly. They have
Rabbis to slaughter their beasts and poultry. They
eat unleavened bread in the Jewish season. They
perform all their Jewish rites as much in secret as
possible, and women as well as men seek whenever
possible to avoid the sacraments of Holy Church.... They
never confess truthfully, and it happened that a
priest, once confessing one of these, cut a fragment of
cloth from his garment, saying: ‘As you have never
sinned, let me have this as a relic to heal the sick.’...
Not without reason did Our Lord call them <i>generatio
prava et adultera</i>. They do not believe that God
rewards virginity and chastity, and all their endeavour
is to multiply. And in the days of the strength of this
heresy many monasteries were violated by their merchants
and wealthy men, and many professed nuns
were ravished and derided, they not believing in or
fearing excommunication, but rather doing this to
vituperate Jesus Christ and the Church. Commonly
swindling people by many wiles and cheats, as in
buying and selling, they have no conscience where
Christians are concerned. Never would they undertake
agriculture, ploughing or tilling or raising cattle,
nor have they ever taught their children any office but
that of sitting down to earn enough to eat by as little
labour as possible. Many of them have raised up
great estates in a few years, not being sparing of
their thieving and usury, maintaining that they earn
it from their enemies....”<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a></p>

<p>This atrocious tissue of misrepresentation would be
utterly negligible and contemptible were it not for the
fact&mdash;as has been said&mdash;that it was written in good
faith (the good faith of a bigot) and reflects what was
currently believed, fostered by the envy which is
plainly revealed when Bernaldez alludes to the occupations
of the Jews and the New-Christians&mdash;all of whom
he assumes to be false to the faith they have embraced.</p>

<p>Isabella must have been conscious of this feeling,
and she must have rated it at its proper value. She
had received in 1474 a very pitiful narrative poem of
the New-Christian Anton Montoro, which painted
with terrible vividness a slaughter of the <i>conversos</i>
and implored justice upon the assassins, protesting
the innocence of the New-Christians and the sincerity
of their conversions. Her gentle nature must have
been moved to compassion by that lament, and her
acute mind must have perceived the evil passions
and the envy that were stirring under the fair cloak
of saintly zeal.</p>

<p>All these considerations being weighed, she resisted
the representations of Ojeda.</p>

<p>But weightier than any may have been the reflection
of the power which the tribunal of the
Inquisition must place in the hands of the clergy.
Already and very bravely she had expressed her
resentment of clerical usurpation of royal rights in
Spain, and to repress it she had not hesitated to
front the Pope himself. If she acceded now to Ojeda’s
request, she would be permitting the priesthood to set
up a court which, not being subject to any temporal
law, must alienate from her some portion of that
sovereignty which so jealously she guarded.</p>

<p>Thus she came to dismiss the petition of the
Dominican, and there can be little doubt when all the
circumstances are considered&mdash;as presently they shall
be&mdash;that in this she had the entire support of the
Cardinal of Spain, Don Pedro Gonzalez de Mendoza,
Archbishop of Seville, who was with her at the time.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span></p>

<p>Ojeda withdrew, baffled, but by no means resigned.
He awaited a more favourable season, what time he
kept the popular feeling in a state of ferment. And
no sooner had Ferdinand come to rejoin his Queen
in Seville than the Dominican renewed his importunities.</p>

<p>He hoped to find an ally in the King. Moreover
he was now supported by Fr. Filippo de’ Barberi, the
Sicilian Inquisitor. The latter had newly arrived in
Spain, where he came to seek at the hands of the
Catholic Sovereigns&mdash;who were rulers of Sicily&mdash;the
confirmation of an ancient decree promulgated in 1223
by the Emperor Frederic II. By virtue of this
decree one-third of the confiscated property of heretics
became the perquisite of the Inquisition; and it also
ordained that the governors of all districts should
afford protection to the inquisitors and assistance in
their work of prosecuting heretics and any Jew who
might have contracted marriage with a Christian.</p>

<p>These privileges the Sovereigns duly confirmed,
accounting it their duty to do so since they related to
the Inquisition as established by Honorius III. But
not on that account did Isabella yet lean towards the
introduction of the tribunal into Castile.</p>

<p>It happened, however, that to the arguments of
Ojeda and Barberi were added the persuasions of the
papal legate <i>a latere</i> at the court of Castile&mdash;Nicolao
Franco, Bishop of Trevisa&mdash;who conceived, no doubt,
that the institution of the Inquisition here would be
pleasing to Pope Sixtus IV, since it must increase the
authority of the Church in Spain.</p>

<p>To Ferdinand it is probable that the suggestion
was not without allurement, since it must have offered
him a way at once to gratify the piety that was his,
and&mdash;out of the confiscations that must ensue from the
prosecution of so very wealthy a section of the community&mdash;to
replenish the almost exhausted coffers of
the treasury. When the way of conscience is also the
way of profit, there is little difficulty in following it.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
But, after all, though joint sovereign of Spain and
paramount in Aragon, Ferdinand had not in Castile
the power of Isabella. It was her kingdom when all
was said, and although his position there was by no
means that of a simple prince-consort, yet he was bound
by law and by policy to remain submissive to her will.
In view of her attitude, he could do little more than
add his own to the persuasions of the three priestly
advocates, and amongst them they so pressed Isabella
that she gave way to the extent of a compromise.</p>

<p>She consented that steps should be taken not only
to check the Judaizing of the New-Christians, but also
to effect conversions among the Jews themselves; and
she entrusted the difficult task of enforcing the observance
of the Christian faith and the Catholic dogmas
to the Cardinal of Spain&mdash;than whom, from a Christian
and humanitarian point of view, no man of his day
could have been more desirable, which is as much as
to say that from the point of view of his Catholic
contemporaries no man could have been less so.</p>

<p>Isabella’s announcement of her determination in
the matter must have come as something of a shock to
Ojeda, who conceived himself on the way to prevail
with her. This concession to his wishes was far from
being the concession that he sought, since it passed
over the heads of the preaching friars, who had
made such work&mdash;by their own methods&mdash;their special
mission.</p>

<p>The Queen, however, had decided, and there was
no more to be said. The Cardinal of Spain went
about his task in that sincere Christian spirit and with
that zeal for truth and justice that is associated with
his name. He compiled for the purpose of his mission
an <i>instrucci&oacute;n</i>, which has not survived, but which Ortiz
de Zu&ntilde;iga<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a> and Pulgar<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a> inform us was in the form of
a catechism.</p>

<p>In this “he indicates,” says Pulgar, “the duties of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
the true Christian from the day of his birth, in the
sacrament of baptism as in all other sacraments which
it is his obligation to receive, as well as what he should
be taught, what believe and what perform as a faithful
Christian at all times and on all days until the day of
his death.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mariana, Zurita, and other historians, upon the
word of Paramo<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a>  and of Salazar de Mendoza, have
ventured to ascribe the establishment of the Inquisition
in Castile to the Cardinal of Spain. Their object in
so doing has been to heap honour and glory upon
his name and memory; for in their opinion he could
have had no greater claim than this to the gratitude
and reverence of humanity. But the justice of a less
bigoted age demands that truth shall prevail in this
respect, and that his memory be deprived of that very
questionable honour. The Cardinal’s contemporaries
do not justify what Paramo claims for him. And, to
reduce the argument to its lowest plane, it would have
been extremely unlikely that Cardinal Mendoza should
advocate the establishment of a court that must deprive
him and the other Spanish bishops of the jurisdiction
in <i>causas de F&eacute;</i> hitherto vested in themselves.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Primate pursued, then, the task imposed upon
him, causing his “catechism” to be expounded and
taught by all parish priests in all pulpits and schools.</p>

<p>But however zealous his methods, they were not
the methods desired by Ojeda and the papal legate.
The Dominican, vexed by the turn of events, and
determined to return to the assault as soon as ever
occasion offered, cast about him for fresh arguments
that should prevail with the Sovereigns.</p>

<p>And then there befell an incident in Seville to
supply his fanatical needs and place in his hands the
very weapon that he sought.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span></p>

<p>A young nobleman of the famous house of Guzman
had engaged in an amorous intrigue with the daughter
of a New-Christian. In the pursuit of this amour he
repaired secretly to her father’s house on the night
of Thursday in Holy Week of that year 1478, and
was admitted by the girl. But the lovers being
disturbed by voices in the house, Guzman was driven
to conceal himself. From his concealment he overheard
the conversation of several Judaizers who were
being entertained by the father of his mistress. He
heard them vehemently denying the divinity of Christ
and as vehemently blaspheming His name and the
Holy Faith.</p>

<p>Having quitted the house, he went straight to the
Prior of the Dominicans to relate what he had overheard
and to denounce the blasphemers.</p>

<p>This young Castilian is so very interesting a type
that a slight digression to consider him more closely
may be permitted. It is of assistance to understand
the mental attitude, the crass complacency of the
bigot. He knew that the highest virtue that a Christian
could practise was the virtue of chastity, and, conversely,
that the worst offence against God into which
he could fall was that of unchastity. Or at least he
had been taught these things, and he accepted them in
a sub-conscious, automatic sort of way. Yet since the
sin was his own, it gave his consciousness no uneasiness
that he should perpetrate it, that he should slink
like a thief into the house of this New-Christian to
debauch his daughter. But let him hear this New-Christian
or his friends express opinions of disbelief
in this God whom he believed in and&mdash;by his own
lights&mdash;insulted, and behold him outraged in all his
feelings against those unspeakable fellows. Behold
him running hot-foot to Prior Ojeda to relate with
horror the tale of this vileness that he had overheard,
so little concerned about the vileness through which
he himself had acquired his knowledge that he makes
no effort to conceal it. And, apparently, the Dominican,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
in a like horror at the New-Christians’ offence against
a God in whom they do not believe, accounts of little
moment the Castilian’s offence against the God in
whom he does believe.</p>

<p>It is a nice illumination of the contrast between the
theory and the practice of Christianity.</p>

<p>Upon the young man’s information Ojeda instituted
an inquiry, and six Judaizers were arrested.
They confessed their guilt, and begged to be reconciled
to the Church. As the Inquisition had not yet
been established, with its terrible decree against
“relapsos,”<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a> their prayer was granted, after the fulfilment
of the penance imposed.<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">56</a></p>

<p>With the tale of this “execrable wickedness”
Ojeda repaired at once to Cordova, whither the
Sovereigns had by now withdrawn. The story would
lose nothing in its repetition by this pious and saintly
man, and he was in a position to add to it that the
good folk of Seville were almost in revolt from
indignation at that happening in their midst.</p>

<p>Having shown thus how urgently it was required,
he once more implored the Sovereigns to establish the
Inquisition. And it is not to be doubted that his
petition would be backed by that of the legate Franco,
who was at the Court.</p>

<p>Yet Isabella still showed repugnance, still hesitated
to consent to the extreme course advocated.</p>

<p>But at this moment, according to Llorente,<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a> another
advocate appears upon the scene to plead the cause
of the Faith&mdash;a figure in the white habit and black
cloak of the Dominican Brotherhood, a man in his
fifty-eighth year, tall and gaunt and stooping slightly
at the shoulders, mild-eyed, of a cast of countenance
that is gentle, noble, and benign.</p>

<p>This is Frey Tom&aacute;s de Torquemada, Prior of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
Dominican Convent of Holy Cross of Segovia, the
nephew of the late illustrious Juan de Torquemada,
Cardinal of San Sisto.</p>

<p>His influence with the Queen is vast; his eloquence
fiery; his mental energy compelling. Ojeda looks on,
and his hopes grow confident at last.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII<br />

<span class="medium">THE PRIOR OF HOLY CROSS</span></h2>

<p>If ever a name held the omen of a man’s life, that
name is Torquemada. To such an extraordinary
degree is it instinct with the suggestion of the
machinery of fire and torture over which he was
destined to preside, that it almost seems a fictitious
name, a <i>nom de guerre</i>, a grim invention, compounded
of the Latin <i>torque</i> and the Spanish <i>quemada</i>, to fit
the man who was to hold the office of Grand
Inquisitor.</p>

<p>It was derived from the northern town of
Torquemada (the Turre Cremata of the Romans),
where the illustrious family had its beginnings. This
family first sprang into historical distinction with the
knighting by Alfonso XI of Lope Alonso de Torquemada
(<i>Hijodalgo a los Fueros de Castilla</i>), and
thereafter was maintained in prominence by several
members who held more or less distinguished offices.
But the most illustrious bearer of the name was the
cultured Dominican Juan de Torquemada (Lope
Alonso’s great-grandson), who was raised to the purple
with the title of Cardinal of San Sisto. He was one
of the most learned, eminent, and respected theologians
of his age, an upholder of the dogma of the Immaculate
Conception, and the most ardent champion since
Thomas Aquinas of the doctrine of papal infallibility.
He enriched theological literature by several works,
the best known of which is his “Meditations.”</p>

<p>Fr. Tom&aacute;s de Torquemada was the son of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
Cardinal’s only brother, Pero Fernandez de Torquemada.
He was born at Valladolid in 1420, and after
a scholastic career of some distinction&mdash;if Garcia
Rodrigo is to be believed in this particular<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">58</a>&mdash;he
followed in his uncle’s footsteps, soliciting the habit
of the Order of St. Dominic, which he assumed in
the Convent of St. Paul of Valladolid upon completing
his studies of philosophy and divinity, and receiving
a doctor’s degree.</p>

<p>He filled with distinction the chair of canon law
and theology, and in the fullness of time was elected
Prior of the Convent of Santa Cruz of Segovia. He
so distinguished himself in the discharge of the duties
of this office by his piety, his learning, and his zeal,
that he was repeatedly re-elected, there being at the
time no rule of the order to inhibit it. Such was the
austerity of his character that he never ate meat, or
used linen either in his clothing or on his bed.<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">59</a> He
observed the rule of poverty imposed by his order so
rigorously that he was unable to provide his only
sister with an endowment suitable to her station, and
could allow her no more than would permit her to
live as a nun under the rule of the tertiary order of
St. Dominic.</p>

<p>At what epoch the Prior of Holy Cross first
became the confessor of the Infanta Isabella it is not
now possible to ascertain. Jaime Bleda tells us that
in the fulfilment of this office he had extracted from
her, during her youth at the Court of her brother
King Henry IV, a promise that should she ever come
to the throne she would devote her life to the extirpation
of heresy from her realm.<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">60</a></p>

<p>This may be dismissed as one of those popular
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
fictions that arise concerning the intimate affairs of
princes, for it cannot be said that it is borne out by
the circumstances under consideration.</p>

<p>Isabella’s reluctance to proceed to extreme&mdash;or
even vigorous&mdash;measures against those of her subjects
accused of Judaizing is admitted by every serious
student of her reign, however opinions may vary as
to the motives that swayed her in this course.</p>

<p>There remains, however, out of Bleda’s anecdote,
the fact that Torquemada had been Isabella’s confessor
in early years&mdash;which in itself bears out the statement
that the Dominican had achieved distinction. It
follows by virtue of his having occupied this office
that he must have acquired over the mind of a woman
so devout a considerable ascendancy where matters
connected with the Faith were concerned.</p>

<p>This influence he came now to exert.</p>

<p>To support it he brought an indubitable sincerity
and disinterestedness of motives; he brought a reputation
for sanctity derived from the rigid purity
of his life and the stern asceticism which he practised&mdash;a
reputation which could not fail to act upon the
imagination of a woman of Isabella’s pious temperament;
and, finally, he brought the dominant, masterful
personality and the burning eloquence that were his
own.</p>

<p>When all this is taken into account it is not surprising
that the Queen’s resistance, weakened already by
the onslaughts of Ojeda and his associates, the King
and the papal legate, should at last have broken down;
and that under the compelling persuasion of the Prior
of Holy Cross she should reluctantly have consented
to the establishment of the Holy Office in her
dominions.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Thus it befell that by order of the Catholic Sovereigns
their Orator at the Pontifical Court, D. Francisco
de Santillana, applied to Sixtus IV for a bull that
should empower Ferdinand and Isabella to set up the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
tribunal of the Inquisition in Castile, to enable them&mdash;as
Bernaldez puts it&mdash;to proceed to the extirpation of
heresy “by the way of fire”&mdash;<i>por via del fuego</i>.</p>

<p>This bull was duly granted under date of November
7, 1478.</p>

<p>It gave the Sovereigns the faculty of electing three
bishops or archbishops or other God-fearing and upright
priests, regular or secular, of over forty years of
age, who must be masters or bachelors of divinity and
doctors or licentiates of canon law, to make inquisition
throughout the kingdom against heretics, apostates, and
their abettors.</p>

<p>His Holiness accorded to the men so elected the
requisite jurisdiction to proceed according to law and
custom, and he further empowered the Sovereigns to
annul such nominations as they might make and to
replace their nominees as they saw fit.<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">61</a></p>

<p>The Sovereigns were in Cordova when the bull
reached them in the following month of December.
But they did not at once proceed to act upon it.
Before doing so, Isabella made one last effort to repress
the Judaizing and apostatizing movement by the
gentler measures concerted with the Cardinal of Spain
in 1477.</p>

<p>To the task of continuing with increased vigour
the teachings of the “catechism” drawn up by
Mendoza she now appointed Diego Alonso de Solis,
Bishop of Cadiz, D. Diego de Merlo, Coadjutor of
Seville, and Alonso de Ojeda, to whom these royal
orders must have been a fresh source of disappointment
and chagrin.</p>

<p>Torquemada, we must assume, had withdrawn
once more to his convent of Segovia, and perhaps the
removal of his stern influence enabled the Queen to
make this last effort to avoid the course to which he
had all but constrained her.</p>

<p>Having concluded these arrangements, the Sovereigns
repaired to Toledo. There, in the spring of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
the year 1480, the Cortes assembled to make oath of
fealty to the infant Prince of Asturias to whom Isabella
had given birth in June of 1478. Whilst this oath
was the chief motive of the assembly, it was by no
means the only business with which it had to deal.
Many other matters received attention; amongst
them the necessity for remedying the evils arising out
of the commerce between Christians and Jews was
seriously considered.</p>

<p>It was decreed that the old laws concerning the
Jews, which lately had been falling into partial desuetude,
should be re-enforced, particularly those which
prescribed that all Jews should wear the distinguishing
badge of the circlet of red cloth on the shoulders of
their gabardines; that they should keep strictly to
their Juderias, always retiring to these at nightfall;
that walls to enclose these Juderias should be erected
wherever they might still be wanting, and that no Jew
should practise as a doctor, surgeon, apothecary, or
innkeeper.</p>

<p>Beyond that, however, the Cortes did not go; and
the institution of the Inquisition to deal with Judaizers
was not so much as mentioned, which circumstance
Llorente accepts as a further proof of the Queen’s
antipathy to the Holy Office.</p>

<p>Coming at a time when the Jews were once more
beginning to taste the sweets of freedom, there can be
little doubt that these provisions, which thrust them
back into bondage and ignominy, must have been
extremely galling to them. It is possible that these
measures against the men of his race spurred a New-Christian
to the rash step of publishing a pamphlet in
which he criticized and censured the royal action in
the matter. Carried away by his feelings, the writer&mdash;intentionally
or not&mdash;fell into heresy in the course of
his writings, to which the Jeronymite monk, Hernando
de Talavera, published a reply.</p>

<p>Rodrigo<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">62</a> assumes that this heretical pamphlet put
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
an end to the Queen’s patience. It may very well have
been the case, or at least it may have afforded Ferdinand
and the others who desired the Inquisition a final
argument whereby to overcome what reluctance still
lingered with her.</p>

<p>Be that as it may, it was very soon after this&mdash;September
27, 1480&mdash;that the Sovereigns, who at the
time were at Medina del Campo, acted at last upon
the papal bull which had now been in their hands for
nearly two years, and delegated their faculty of giving
inquisitors to Castile to the Cardinal of Spain and
Fr. Tom&aacute;s de Torquemada.</p>

<p>Mendoza and Torquemada proceeded at once to
carry out the task entrusted to them, and appointed as
inquisitors of the faith for Seville&mdash;where Judaizing
was represented to be most flagrant&mdash;the Dominican
friars Juan de San Martino and Miguel Morillo. The
latter was the Provincial of the Dominicans of Aragon,
and was already a person of experience in such matters,
having acted as inquisitor in Rousillon. To assist
them in the discharge of their office, the secular priest
Juan Ruiz de Medina, a doctor of canon law, and Juan
Lopez de Barco, one of the Queen’s chaplains, were
appointed, the former to the position of assessor, the
latter to that of fiscal.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It is necessary, in view of the much that has been
written, and although the danger be incurred of labouring
the point, to examine more closely the attitude of
the Sovereigns towards the tribunal which they now
sanctioned.</p>

<p>Isabella’s zeal, both pious and political, urged her,
as has been said, to proceed in such a way as should
set a term to the unrest arising out of the public feeling
against Judaizers and apostatizing Moriscoes (baptized
Moors). Ferdinand not only shared her feelings, but
pious zeal in him went to the lengths of bigotry, and
he aimed essentially at a political unity that should be
inseparably allied and interwoven with religious unity.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span></p>

<p>Isabella would have laboured slowly, preferring,
even at the sacrifice of time, to achieve her ends by
gentle means and the exercise of that patience which
was so very necessary if good results were to be
obtained. Ferdinand, perhaps less pitiful, perhaps&mdash;to
do him full justice&mdash;less hopeful of the power of
argument and indoctrination, lending an ear to the
priestly assertion “contra negantes veritatis nulla est
disputatio,” would have proceeded at once to the introduction
into Castile of the stern repressive measures
already being exerted in his native Aragon.</p>

<p>On the score of their different attitudes the
Sovereigns might have found themselves in conflict,
but that in this matter they had a ground of common
interest. Both were agreed that in no case should
Spain be brought under the ecclesiastical sway which
the establishment of the usual form of Inquisition must
set up. If this were to be&mdash;as usual hitherto&mdash;under
pontifical control, its officers would be appointed by
the Pope, or, vicariously, by the Dominican provincials,
and a proportion of the confiscations consequent
upon conviction would be gathered into the pontifical
coffers.</p>

<p>For all his bigotry and his desire to see the Holy
Office instituted in Castile, Ferdinand was as averse
as Isabella to its introduction in a form that must
restore the clerical usurpations they had been at such
pains to repress.</p>

<p>If Isabella admitted the Inquisition as a last means
of quelling the disturbing elements in her kingdom, it
must be an Inquisition on lines entirely different from
those which hitherto had obtained elsewhere. The
appointment of its officers must no more rest with
the Pope than the bestowal of Spanish benefices. It
must be the prerogative of the Sovereigns themselves,
and it must carry with it the power to depose and
replace, where necessary, such inquisitors as they
might appoint. Further, Rome must have no share
in the property confiscated from Spanish subjects,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
the disposal of this being entirely controlled by the
Sovereigns.</p>

<p>It has been argued that here was the cause of all
Isabella’s hesitancy: that greed and statecraft were
the mainsprings of her conduct in the matter, and
that humanitarian considerations had no part in it;
that the bull had been applied for earlier than has
been generally supposed, and that the delay had
resulted from the Pope’s disinclination to grant any
such terms as were demanded.</p>

<p>The latter statement may not be without foundation.
But to say deliberately that no humanitarian considerations
governed the Queen’s conduct is to say a
great deal more than the circumstances warrant. To
establish this hypothesis it would be necessary to
advance some adequate reason for her reluctance to
act upon the bull when once it was in her hands.
For the bull of November 1478 conceded all that
the Sovereigns demanded, all that they desired. Yet
Isabella allowed nearly two years to pass before
proceeding to exercise the faculties conferred by it,
and during that time Cardinal Mendoza and his co-operators
diligently pursued the work of effecting
conversions by means of his “catechism.”</p>

<p>The conclusion that this was dictated by
humane considerations on the part of the Queen
is the only one that appears reasonable, nor is any
alternative put forward to account for the delay of
nearly two years.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When the Cardinal of Spain and the Prior of
Holy Cross, acting jointly on behalf of the Sovereigns,
appointed the first inquisitors for Castile, they instructed
these to set up a tribunal in Seville, which of
all the cities of Spain was the one where Judaizing
was alleged to be most flagrantly conducted.<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">63</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span></p>

<p>The Sovereigns issued on October 9 a command
to all loyal subjects to afford the two inquisitors every
assistance they might require on their journey to
Seville and all facilities there for carrying out their
mission.</p>

<p>The subjects, however, were so little loyal on this
occasion that upon the arrival of the inquisitors at
Seville, these found a reception of all solemnity awaiting
them and every respect accorded to them, but
no assistance. To such an extent was this withheld
that they found it quite impossible to set about the
business upon which they came. They complained
of this state of things to the King, and as a result
he sent special orders on December 27 to the Coadjutor
of Seville and the civil authorities of the
district, commanding them to lend the inquisitors
every support.</p>

<p>In consequence of this they were at last enabled
to establish their court and proceed to the business
upon which they came.<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">64</a></p>

<p>The very rumour of their approach had filled the
New-Christians with anxiety, and a glimpse of the
gloomy funereal pageant&mdash;the white-robed, black-hooded
inquisitors, with their attendant familiars and
barefoot friars, the procession headed by a Dominican
carrying the white cross&mdash;on its way to the Convent
of St. Paul, where they took up their quarters, was
enough to put to flight some thousands of those who
had cause to fear that they might become the objects
of the attention of that fearful court.</p>

<p>These fugitives sought refuge in the feudal lordships
of the Duke of Medina Sidonia, of the formidable
Rodrigo Ponce de Leon, Marquis of Cadiz, and of
the Count of Arcos.</p>

<p>But in all ages it had been the way of the Inquisition
not only to suspect readily, but to allow suspicion
to usurp the place that elsewhere is reserved for proof.
And so they proceeded to construe into evidence of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
guilt this flight of the timorous, as is shown by the
edict they published on January 2 of 1481.</p>

<p>In this&mdash;having set forth their appointment by
the Sovereigns, and the terms of the bull under which
such appointment had been made&mdash;they announced
that, inasmuch as it had come to their knowledge
that many persons had departed out of Seville in
fear of prosecution upon grounds of heretical pravity,
they commanded the Marquess of Cadiz, the Count
of Arcos, and the other nobles of the Kingdom of
Castile, that within fifteen days of the publication
of this edict they should make an exact account of
the persons of both sexes that had sought refuge
in their lordships or jurisdictions; that they should
arrest all these and bring them safely to the prison
of the Inquisition in Seville, confiscating their property
and placing this together with an inventory
in the hands of some person of trust, to be held by
them at the disposal of the inquisitors; that none
should dare to shelter any fugitive, but comply exactly
with the terms of this edict under pain of greater
excommunication and the other penalties by law
established against abettors of heretics, amongst which
penalties was that of the annulment of their dignities
and offices, their subjects and vassals being absolved
of all vassalage and subjection; and the inquisitors
reserved to themselves and their superiors the power
of absolution from the ecclesiastical censure incurred
by all who might fail to obey the terms of this edict.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII<br />

<span class="medium">THE HOLY OFFICE IN SEVILLE</span></h2>

<p>The stern purpose of the inquisitors and the severity
with which they intended to proceed were plainly
revealed by that edict of January 2, 1481. The
harsh injustice that lay in its call upon the authorities
to arrest men and women merely because they had
departed from Seville before departure was in any way
forbidden is typical of the flagrantly arbitrary methods
of the Inquisition. That it should have struck terror
into the New-Christians who had remained in Seville,
and that it should have moved them to take measures
to protect themselves against a court in which justice
seemed little likely to be observed, and to whose cruel
mercies the most innocent might find himself exposed
at any moment, is not surprising&mdash;particularly when it
is considered how great was the number of New-Christians
who occupied positions of eminence in
Seville.</p>

<p>A group of these prominent citizens assembled at
the invitation of Diego de Susan, one of the wealthiest
and most influential men of Seville, whose fortune
was estimated at ten million maravedis. They came
together to consider what measures should be taken
for the defence of themselves, their persons and
property, from the unscrupulous activities of this
tribunal, and they determined that if necessary they
would resort to force.</p>

<p>Among those who entered into this conspiracy
were some ecclesiastics, and several who held office
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
under the Crown, such as the Governor of Triana,
Juan Fernandez Abolafio, the Captain of Justice and
farmer of the royal customs, his brother Fernandez
the licentiate, Bartolom&eacute; Torralba, and the wealthy
and well-connected Manuel Sauli.</p>

<p>Susan addressed them. He reminded them that they
were the principal citizens of Seville, that they were
wealthy not only in property but in the good-will of
the people, and that it but required resolution and
solidarity on their part to enable them to prevail
against the inquisitors in the event of these friars
making any attempt upon them.</p>

<p>All concurring, it was concerted that each of the
conspirators should engage himself to provide a proportion
of the men, arms, and money and what else
might be necessary for their purpose.</p>

<p>But Susan to his undoing had a daughter. This
girl, whose beauty was so extraordinary that she was
surnamed <i>la hermosa fembra</i>, had taken a Castilian
lover. What motives may have actuated her, what
part the lover may have played in these, does not
transpire. All that is known is that she betrayed the
conspiracy to the inquisitors&mdash;“impiously violating
the natural laws engraved by God’s finger upon the
human heart.”</p>

<p>Susan and his unfortunate confederates were seized
as a consequence of that infamous delation; they were
lodged in the cells of the Convent of St. Paul, which
meanwhile did duty as a prison, and brought to trial
before the Court of the Holy Office sitting in the
convent.<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">65</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span></p>

<p>They were tried for heresy and apostasy, of
course; since upon no other grounds was it possible
for the Holy Office to deal with them. It is unfortunate
that Llorente should have unearthed no
record of this trial&mdash;one of the first held by the Inquisition
in Castile&mdash;and that nothing should be known
of what took place beyond the fact that Susan, Sauli,
Bartolom&eacute; Torralba, and the brothers Fernandez were
found guilty of the alleged offence of apostasy and
were delivered up to the secular arm for punishment.</p>

<p>Garcia Rodrigo has devoted a couple of pages of
his “Historia Verdadera” to an elaborate piece
of fiction in which he asserts that these men were
persistent in their error in spite of the strenuous
efforts made to save them. He invests the fanatical
Ojeda with the character of an angel of mercy, and
represents him hovering round the condemned, exhorting
them, almost with tears, to abjure their error,
and he assures us that although the Dominican persevered
in his charitable efforts up to the last moment,
all was vain.</p>

<p>There is not a grain of evidence to support the
statement, nor does Garcia Rodrigo pretend to advance
any. As a matter of fact, Bernaldez, the only available
authority who mentions Susan’s end, tells us
specifically that he died a Christian. And when it is
considered that Bernaldez is an ardent admirer and
champion of the Inquisition, such a pronouncement
from his pen is sufficient to convict the inquisitors
Morillo and San Martin of having proceeded in a
manner that was vindictive and <i>ultra vires</i>. For at
this epoch it was not yet decreed that those who had
relapsed (<i>relapsos</i>) should suffer capital punishment
unless they persisted in their apostasy&mdash;as Rodrigo,
obviously for the purpose of justifying the inquisitors,
unwarrantably asserts did Susan and his confederates.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span></p>

<p>Llorente considers the blood-lust of the inquisitors
established by these merciless convictions,
urging that it is incredible that all the prisoners should
have refused to recant and to submit themselves to
penance&mdash;even assuming that they were actually
guilty of apostasy as alleged. For when all is considered
it must remain extremely doubtful whether they
had Judaized at all, and it is not improbable&mdash;from
what we see of the spirit that actuated the inquisitors&mdash;that
Morillo and San Martin may have construed
the action of those men into an offence against the
Faith for the purpose of bringing them within the
jurisdiction of the Holy Office.</p>

<p>They were condemned to be the chief actors in
the first Auto de F&eacute; that was held in Seville. This
took place on February 6.<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">66</a></p>

<p>There was about this Auto comparatively little of
that pomp and ceremonial, that ghastly theatricality
that was presently to distinguish these proceedings.
But the essentials were already present.</p>

<p>Susan and his fellows were led forth barefoot, in
the ignominious, yellow penitential sack, a candle in
the hand of each. Hemmed about by halberdiers, they
were paraded through the streets of a city in which
they had won the goodwill and respect of all, to be
gazed upon by a people whose eyes must have been
filled with horror and dismay. To head the procession
went a black-robed Dominican holding aloft the green
cross of the Inquisition, now swathed in a veil of
crape; behind him, walking two by two, came the
familiars of the Holy Office, members of the Confraternity
of St. Peter the Martyr; next followed the
doomed men amid their guards; and last came the
inquisitors with their attendants and a considerable
body of Dominicans from the Convent of St. Paul,
headed by their prior, the fanatical Ojeda.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span></p>

<p>The procession headed for the Cathedral, where
the sufferers were taken to hear Mass and forced to
listen to a sermon framed for the occasion which was
preached by Ojeda, and must have increased the
exquisite torment of their protracted agony. Thence
they were conducted&mdash;once more processionally&mdash;out
of the city to the meadows of Tablada. There they
were attached to the stakes that had been erected,
fire was set to the faggots, and thus they perished
miserably, to the greater honour and glory of the
Catholic Apostolic Church.<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">67</a></p>

<p>Ojeda may have looked with satisfaction upon
that holocaust, upon those cruel flames which more
than any man in Spain he had been instrumental in
kindling, and which being kindled would continue to
cast their lurid glow over that fair land for close
upon four centuries. It was the first burning that
Ojeda witnessed, and it was the last. His own hour
was at hand. His mission, whatever ends it had to
serve in the eternal scheme of things, was completed
there on the meadows of Tablada, and he might now
depart. A few days later he lay dead, stricken down
by the plague that was ravaging the south of Spain,
and sought him out for one of its first victims.</p>

<p>And from the pulpits of Seville the Dominicans
thundered forth declarations that this pestilence was a
visitation of God upon an unfaithful city. They never
paused to consider that if that were indeed the case
either God’s aim must be singularly untrue since the
shafts of His wrath overtook such faithful servants as
Ojeda, or else....</p>

<p>But an incapacity to conduct its reasonings to a
logical conclusion, and an utter want of any sense of
proportion, are the main factors in all fanaticism.</p>

<p>Lest they should themselves be stricken by these
bolts of pestilence launched against the unfaithful,
behold next the inquisitors scuttling out of Seville!
They go in quest of more salubrious districts, and,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
presumably upon the assumption that these&mdash;since
they remain healthy&mdash;are escaping divine attention,
the Dominicans zealously proceed to light their fires
that they may repair this heavenly oversight.<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">68</a></p>

<p>But that <i>villegiatura</i> of theirs did not take place
until they had transacted a deal more of their horrible
business in Seville. Great had been the results of the
edict of January 2. The nobles, not daring to run
the risk of the threatened ecclesiastical censure,
proceeded to effect the arrests demanded, and gangs
of pinioned captives were brought daily into the city
from the surrounding country districts where they had
sought shelter. And in the city itself the familiars
of the Holy Office were busily effecting the capture
of suspects and of those against whom, either out of
bigotry or malice, delations had been made.</p>

<p>So numerous were the arrests that by the middle
of the month of January already the capacity of the
Convent of St. Paul was strained to its utmost, and
the inquisitors were compelled to remove themselves,
their tribunal and their prison to the ampler quarters
of the Castle of Triana, accorded to them by the
Sovereigns in response to their request for it.<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">69</a></p>

<p>The edict of January 2 was soon succeeded by a
second one, known as the “Edict of Grace.” This
exhorted all who were guilty of apostasy to come
forward voluntarily within a term appointed, to confess
their sins and be reconciled to the Church. It assured
them that if they did this with real contrition and a
firm purpose of amendment, they should receive absolution
and suffer no confiscation of property. And it
concluded with a warning that if they allowed the
term of grace to expire without taking advantage of it,
and they should afterwards be accused by others, they
would be prosecuted with the utmost rigour of the law.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span></p>

<p>Amador de los Rios is of opinion that Cardinal
Mendoza was “instrumental” in having this edict
published, in which case it would hardly be too much
to assume that he was the instrument of Isabella in
the matter. Nor is it too much to assume that the
inspiration was purely merciful, and that there was no
thought in the mind of either Queen or Cardinal of the
edict’s being turned, as it was, to treacherous account.</p>

<p>The response was immediate. It is estimated that
not less than 20,000 <i>conversos</i> who had been guilty of
Judaizing came forward to avail themselves of its
promise of amnesty and to secure absolution for their
infidelity to the religion they had embraced. They
discovered to their horror that they had walked into a
trap as cruel as any that smooth-faced, benign-voiced
priestcraft had ever devised.</p>

<p>The inquisitors had thought well to saddle the
promised absolution and immunity from punishment
with a condition which they had not published, a
condition which they had secretly reserved to spring
it now upon these self-convicted apostates at their
mercy. They pointed out with infernal subtlety that
the edict provided that the contrition of the self-accused
must be sincere, and that of this sincerity the
penitents must give the only proof possible by disclosing
the names of all Judaizers known to them.</p>

<p>The demand was an infamy; for not even under
the seal of private confession is a priest authorized to
impose upon a penitent as a condition of absolution
that he shall divulge the name even of an accomplice
or a partner in guilt. Yet here it was demanded of
these that they should go much further, and denounce
such sinners as they knew; and the demand was
framed in such specious terms&mdash;as the only proof
they could offer of the sincerity of their own contrition&mdash;that
none dared have taxed the inquisitors with
malpractice or with subverting the ends and purpose
of this edict they had been forced to publish.</p>

<p>The wretched apostates found themselves between
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
the sword and the wall. Either they must perpetrate
the infamy of betraying those of their race whom they
knew to be Judaizers, or they must submit not only to
the cruel death by fire, but to the destitution of their
children as a consequence of the confiscation of their
property. Most of them gave way, and purchased
their reconciliation at the price of betrayal. And there
were men like Bernaldez, the parish priest of Palacios,
who applauded this procedure of the Holy Office. “A
very glorious thing” (<i>muy haza&ntilde;osa cosa</i>), he exclaims,
“was the reconciliation of these people, as thus
by their confessions were discovered all that were
Judaizers, and in Seville knowledge was obtained of
Judaizers in Toledo, Cordova, and Burgos.”<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">70</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Upon the expiry of the term of grace a further
edict was published by Morillo and San Martin, in
which they now commanded, under pain of mortal
sin and greater excommunication, with its attendant
penalties, the discovery of all persons known to be
engaged in Judaizing practices.</p>

<p>And that there should be no excuse offered by any
on the score of ignorance of such practices, these
were published in thirty-seven articles appended to
the edict, articles whose malign comprehensiveness
left no man secure.</p>

<p>They set forth the following signs by which
New-Christians guilty of Judaizing might be recognized:</p>

<blockquote class="list">

<p>I. Any who await the Messiah, or say that he
has not yet come, and that he will come to
lead them out of captivity into the promised
land.</p>

<p>II. Any who after baptism have returned expressly
to the Mosaic faith.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span></p>

<p>III. Any who declare that the law of Moses is as
good as that of Jesus Christ and as efficient
for salvation.</p>

<p>IV. Any who keep the Sabbath in honour of the
law of Moses&mdash;of which the proof is afforded
by their assuming clean shirts and more decent
garments than on other days, and clean covers
on the table, as well as by their refraining from
lighting fires and from engaging in all work
from Friday evening.</p>

<p>V. Any who strip the tallow or fat from meats
that they are to eat and purify it by washing in
water, bleeding it, or extracting the glandule
from the leg of lambs or other animals slaughtered
for food.</p>

<p>VI. Any who cut the throats of animals or poultry
that are intended for food, first testing the
knife on their finger-nail, covering the blood
with earth, and uttering certain words that are
customary among Jews.</p>

<p>VII. Any who eat meat in Lent and on other days
on which it is forbidden by Holy Church.</p>

<p>VIII. Any who keep the great fast of the Jews
known by different names, or the fast of
<i>Chiphurim</i> or <i>Quipur</i> in the tenth Hebrew
month&mdash;whereof the proof shall be their having
gone barefoot during the period of the said
fast, as is the custom of the Jews, their having
said Jewish prayers, or asked pardon one of
another, or fathers having laid hands upon the
heads of their children without making the sign
of the Cross or saying anything but “By God
and by me be thou blessed.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span></p>

<p>IX and X. Any who keep the fast of Queen Esther,
which is observed by the Jews in memory and
imitation of what they did in captivity in the
reign of Ahasuerus, or the fast of <i>Rebeaso</i>.</p>

<p>XI. Any who shall keep other fasts peculiar to the
Jews, such as those of Monday and Thursday,
of which the proof shall be: their not eating
on such days until after the appearance of the
first evening star; their having abstained from
meat; their having washed on the previous
day or cut their nails or the points of their
hair, keeping or burning these; their reciting
certain Jewish prayers, raising or lowering
their heads with their faces to the wall, after
washing their hands in water or in earth; their
dressing themselves in sackcloth and girding
themselves with cords or strips of leather.</p>

<p>XII, XIII, and XIV concern any who keep the
Paschal seasons; which is to be discovered by
their setting up green boughs, inviting to table
and sending presents of comestibles, and the
keeping of the feast of candles.</p>

<p>XV to XIX concern any who observe Hebrew table-customs:
whether they bless their viands
according to the Jewish custom, whether they
drink “lawful” wine&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> wine that has been
pressed by Jews&mdash;and eat meat that has been
slaughtered by Jews.</p>

<p>XX. Any who recite the Psalms of David without
concluding with the versicle “Gloria Patri
et Filio et Spiritu Sancto.”</p>

<p>XXI. Any woman who abstains from going to
church for forty days after delivery of child,
out of reverence for the law of Moses.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span></p>

<p>XXII to XXVI concern any who circumcise their
children, give them Hebrew names, or
after baptism cause their heads to be
shaven where anointed with the sacred
oil, or any who cause their children to be
washed on the seventh day after birth in
a basin in which, in addition to the water,
they have placed gold and silver, pearls,
wheat, barley, and other things.</p>

<p>XXVII. Any who are married in the Jewish
manner.</p>

<p>XXVIII. Any who hold the <i>Ruaya</i>&mdash;which is a
valedictory supper before setting out upon
a long journey.</p>

<p>XXIX and XXX. Any who carry Hebrew relics or
make burnt-offerings of bread.</p>

<p>XXXI. Any who <i>in articulo mortis</i> have turned
or been turned with their faces to the
wall to die in this attitude.</p>

<p>XXXII. Any who wash a corpse in warm water or
shave it according to the Jewish custom,
and otherwise dress it for the grave as
is prescribed by the Mosaic law.</p>

<p>XXXIII to XXXVI concern Jewish expressions of
mourning, such as the abstaining from
meat, the spilling of water from the jars
in the dwelling of the deceased, etc.</p>

<p>XXXVII. Any who bury their dead in virgin soil or
in a Jewish cemetery.<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">71</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Reference has already been made to the inherent
character of many Jewish customs, which even the
most sincere of New-Christians retained despite themselves;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
these customs, being racial rather than religious,
were very far from signifying Judaic apostasy, since
they contained nothing that was directly opposed to
the Christian teaching. In the list published by the
Seville inquisitors it will be seen that such customs
were deliberately included as evidences of apostasy.</p>

<p>Consider Articles IV, V, and VII, concerning the
assumption of clean linen on Saturdays and the stripping
of fat from beef and mutton, which nowise
offend against the Christian faith, and might well be
the perpetuation of customs acquired before baptism
was received.</p>

<p>Even more flagrant is Article XXXI, which lays
it down as evidence of Judaizing that a man shall turn
his face to the wall when at the point of death; but
most flagrant of all is Article XXVIII, concerning the
valedictory meal partaken of before setting out upon
a journey, for it is a custom that at all times has been
as much in vogue among Christians as among men of
any other religion.</p>

<p>Clearly not a New-Christian in Seville was safe
from the delations of the malevolent, since such
ridiculously slight grounds of suspicion were set forth
by the tribunal. So extravagant and absurd are some
of these articles that one is forced to agree with
Llorente, that in formulating them the inquisitors
proceeded with deliberate malice. He contends that
deliberately they cast a wide net that by their heavy
draught they should satisfy the Queen that she had
heard no more than the truth as to the extent to which
Judaizing was rampant in Castile, and the urgent
need there was for the introduction of the Inquisition.</p>

<p>Whether in this they proceeded according to instructions
received from Torquemada or Ojeda does
not transpire, but there can be little doubt that the
results obtained must have been in accordance with
the wishes of both, since they justified to the Queen
the representations these friars had so insistently
made to her.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span></p>

<p>And the system of espionage which the inquisitors
set up to increase their haul of victims was as sly and
cunning as anything in the history of spying. Conceive
the astuteness of the friar who climbed to the roof
of the Convent of St. Paul on Saturday mornings
to observe and note the houses of New-Christians
from whose chimneys no smoke was to be seen issuing,
that he might lay the information thus obtained
before the tribunal, which would proceed to arrest the
inhabitants upon a strong suspicion that they were
Judaizers who would not desecrate the Sabbath by
lighting fires.<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">72</a></p>

<p>“What,” asks Llorente, “could be expected of a
tribunal that began in this way?” And he at once
supplies the answer: “That which happened&mdash;neither
more nor less.”</p>

<p>With the methods of procedure that obtained in
the trials conducted by these inquisitors we need not
just now concern ourselves. For the moment it is
enough to say that to the vices inherent in such a
judicial system must be added, in the case of the first
inquisitors of Seville, a zeal&mdash;not only to convict, but
actually to be burning heretics&mdash;so ferociously excessive
as to proclaim that they were gratifying their hatred
of these Jews.</p>

<p>This upon the word of that sober chronicler Pulgar,
who, whilst in general terms approving the introduction
of the Inquisition, as has been seen, denounces in
the following particular terms the practices of Morillo
and San Martin: “In the manner in which they
conducted their proceedings they showed that they
held those people in hatred.”<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">73</a></p>

<p>The Auto of February 6 was followed by
another on March 26, at which seventeen victims
were burnt on the fields of Tablada. And now
that the fires were lighted, the inquisitors saw to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
it that they were well supplied with human fuel.
Burnings followed one another at such a rate
that by the month of November&mdash;upon the word
of Llorente&mdash;298 condemned had been sent to the
flames in the town of Seville alone, whilst 79 others
by reconciling themselves to the Church secured the
commutation of their sentence to one of perpetual
imprisonment.</p>

<p>Mariana, the historian who gave thanks to God
for the introduction of the Inquisition into Castile,
informs us with flagrant calm that the number of
Judaizers burnt in the Archbishopric during that year
1481 amounted to 8,000, whilst some 17,000 were
submitted to penance.</p>

<p>In addition to those burnt alive, many who had
fled the country were burnt in effigy, having been
tried and found guilty during an absence described
as contumacious. And similarly the court went
through the horrible farce of sitting in judgment
upon many who were dead, and, having convicted
them, it dug up their bones and flung these to the
flames.</p>

<p>Such was the prodigious activity of the Holy
Office, and to such an extent did its holocausts
promise to continue, that the Governor of Seville
ordered the erection on the fields of Tablada of a
permanent platform of stone of vast proportions known
as the Quemadero, or Burning-place. It was adorned
by figures of the four Prophets. At each of its four
corners towered one of these colossal statues of plaster,
and Llorente tells us that they were not merely for
ornament. He says that they were hollow and so
contrived that a condemned person might be placed
in each and so die by slow fire.<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">74</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span></p>

<p>This Quemadero remained standing, a monument
to religious intolerance and fanatical cruelty, until the
soldiers of Napoleon demolished it in the nineteenth
century.<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">75</a></p>

<p>So ruthless were Morillo and San Martin, and so
negligent of equity or even the observance of the
ordinary rules of judicial procedure, that in the end
we find the Pope himself&mdash;in January of 1482&mdash;addressing
a letter of protest to the Sovereigns.</p>

<p>The first edict commanding the nobles to arrest all
those who had fled from Seville had had the effect of
driving many of these fugitive New-Christians farther
afield in their quest for safety. Some had escaped
into Portugal, others had crossed the Mediterranean
and sought shelter in Morocco, whilst others still had
taken their courage in both hands and sought sanctuary
in Rome itself, at the very feet of the Pontiff. Other
fugitives followed presently, when the tribunal had
already inaugurated its terrible work; and these came
clamouring their grievances and protesting that in
spite of their innocence they dared no longer remain
in a State where no New-Christian was safe from the
hatred and injustice shown by the inquisitors to men
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
of their race. Therefore they were driven to seek
from Christ’s Vicar the protection to which all Christians
and true Catholics were entitled at his hands.</p>

</div>

<p>They informed the Pontiff of the methods that
were being pursued; they set forth how the inquisitors
in their eagerness to secure convictions proceeded
entirely upon their own initiative and without the concurrence
of the assessor and diocesan ordinary, as had
been prescribed; how they were departing from all
legal form, imprisoning unjustly, torturing cruelly and
unduly, and falsely stigmatizing innocent men as formal
heretics, thereafter delivering them to the secular arm
for punishment, in addition to confiscating their property
so that their children were left in want and under
the brand of infamy.</p>

<p>The Pope gave ear to these plaints, convinced himself
of their truth, and made his protest to Ferdinand
and Isabella. He announced in his brief that he
would have deprived the inquisitors of their office but
that he was restrained by consideration for the Sovereigns
who had appointed them; nevertheless, he was
sending them a brief of admonition, and should they
again give cause for complaint he would be constrained
to depose them. In the meantime he revoked the
faculty given the Sovereigns of appointing inquisitors,
protesting that when conceding this he had not sufficiently
considered that already there were inquisitors
in the Sovereigns’ dominions and that the General of
the Dominicans and the Spanish provincials of that
order had the right to make such appointments. The
bull that he had granted was therefore in opposition to
that right, and would never have been granted had the
matter been sufficiently considered.<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">76</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX<br />

<span class="medium">THE SUPREME COUNCIL</span></h2>

<p>The Sovereigns appear to have submitted without
protest to this papal interference and to the revocation
of the faculty bestowed upon them of nominating the
inquisitors in their kingdom. This submission was
hardly to have been expected from their earlier attitude,
but there are two reasons, either or both of which
may possibly account for it.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that there was a considerable
number of New-Christians about the Court and in
immediate attendance upon the Queen, one of whom
was her secretary Pulgar. What view Pulgar took of
the Seville proceedings we know, and it is not too
much to assume that his view was the view of all
Christians of Jewish extraction. These New-Christians
and others may very well have urged upon the notice
of the Sovereigns the cruelties and injustices that were
being practised, drawing their attention to the decree
that made innocent children suffer for the offences of
which their parents had been convicted&mdash;a decree
which, hideous enough when the parents were actually
guilty, became unspeakably hideous when that guilt
was no more than presumed.</p>

<p>In view of such representations the Sovereigns
may have found the papal rebuke unanswerable and
the Pope’s action justified.</p>

<p>Then, again, they may have taken into consideration
the projected war upon Granada, the last province
of the peninsula remaining in Moorish hands. Funds
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
were urgently required for this campaign, and the confiscations
that were daily being effected by the Holy
Office were rapidly supplying these&mdash;for the early
victims of the Inquisition, as we know, were persons of
great wealth and distinction.<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">77</a></p>

<p>Now the papal brief, whilst it cancelled the royal
prerogative of appointing inquisitors, did not attempt
to divert the course of this stream of confiscated property,
nor, indeed, made any mention of the matter.
So that they may have hesitated to oppose themselves
to measures which they recognized as just and which
continued to supply them with the means for what
they looked upon as a righteous crusade.</p>

<p>Bigotry and acquisitiveness were again joining
forces, and, united, they must prove, as ever,
irresistible.</p>

<p>But on February 11, 1482, the Roman Curia
issued another brief addressed to the Sovereigns,
wherein&mdash;entirely ignoring what already had been
written&mdash;it was announced that the General of the
Dominicans, Fr. Alonso de Cebrian, having represented
to the Pope the need to multiply the number
of inquisitors in Spain, his Holiness had resolved to
appoint the said Fr. Alonso and seven other Dominicans
to conduct the affairs of the Holy Office in that
kingdom, commanding them to exercise their ministry
in conjunction with the diocesan ordinary and in accordance
with the terms set forth in the briefs that were
being addressed to them.<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">78</a></p>

<p>One of the eight Dominicans mentioned by the
Pope was Fr. Tom&aacute;s de Torquemada, who by now
was become confessor to the King and to the Cardinal
of Spain.</p>

<p>This brief, following so rapidly upon that which
revoked the Sovereigns’ power, may have caused
Ferdinand and Isabella to look upon it as the second
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
move in an intrigue whose aim was to strengthen the
ecclesiastical arm in Spain to the detriment of the
royal authority.</p>

<p>On April 17 Sixtus sent the promised instructions
to the inquisitors of Aragon, Catalu&ntilde;a, Valencia,
and Mallorca. These indicated a procedure in matters
of faith so contrary to common law, that no sooner did
the inquisitors attempt to carry them into execution
than there was an uproar which afforded Ferdinand
grounds upon which to indite a protest to the Holy
Father.</p>

<p>A reply came in the following October. Sixtus
wrote that the briefs of last April had been drawn up
after conference with several members of the Sacred
College; that these cardinals were now absent from
Rome, but that on their return the matter should be
further considered. Meanwhile, however, in view of
the results that had attended those briefs, he was
informing the inquisitors that they were exempt from
acting upon the terms set forth in them and instructing
them to proceed, as formerly, in co-operation with the
diocesan ordinaries.</p>

<p>But in the meantime, for all the Pope’s protest
against the excessive severity of the Seville tribunal,
this severity continued so undiminished, not only in
Seville but also in the districts under the jurisdiction
of other inquisitors, that there was a continuous emigration
from Spain of the wealthy New-Christian families.
Many of these repaired to Rome to appeal to the
Pontifical Courts and to procure there an absolution
which should accord them immunity from the Spanish
tribunals of the Holy Office.</p>

<p>But even when this absolution was procured a large
number of these emigrants never thought of returning
to Spain, considering it wiser to settle in a country in
which they were in less danger of persecution.</p>

<p>Although it is certain that the Sovereigns can have
had no prevision of what actually was to happen as
a consequence&mdash;though not in their own day, nor for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
some time afterwards&mdash;although they may have been
very far from foreseeing that by driving out these
energetic, industrious, intelligent men they were depriving
the country of the financially able, wealth-producing
element of the community&mdash;still they did
undoubtedly perceive what was immediately before
them; and they began to fear the possibility of their
country’s being drained of its present wealth if these
emigrations were to continue.</p>

<p>So Isabella wrote to the Pope entreating him to
establish a court of appeal in Spain, and thus dispose
that proceedings started within the kingdom could
there be carried to their conclusion without the need
for these appeals to Rome. To this the Pope replied
in affectionate terms on February 23, 1483, promising
to give the matter every consideration.<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">79</a></p>

<p>Shortly thereafter he held a conference of the
Spanish Cardinals, the principal of whom in wealth,
importance, and distinction was Roderigo Borgia,
Cardinal of Valencia. At this conference several provisions
were agreed upon, and these were embodied
in the briefs dispatched from the Vatican on May 25
following.</p>

<p>The first of these was to the Sovereigns. It contained
a gracious assent to their petition, and exhorted
them to be zealous in this matter of the Faith, reminding
them that Jehu had consolidated his kingdom by the
destruction of idolatry, and that the Sovereigns would
meet with the same good fortune, as already God was
giving them many victories over the Moors to reward
their piety and the purity of their faith.</p>

<p>The second was to I&ntilde;igo Manrique, Archbishop of
Seville (having succeeded in this see to the Cardinal
of Spain, who was now Archbishop of Toledo),
appointing him judge of appeal in <i>Causas de F&eacute;</i>.</p>

<p>The remaining briefs were addressed to the Archbishop
of Toledo and the other Spanish archbishops,
commanding them, to the end that the functions of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
Inquisition should be discharged with integrity, that
in the event of there being in their ecclesiastical
provinces any bishops who were of Jewish descent,
they should suavely admonish these not to intervene
in person in the proceedings of the Holy Office, but to
allow themselves to be represented by their principal
officials, provisors, and diocesan vicars-general&mdash;always
provided that none of these was of Jewish
blood.</p>

<p>This decree was natural enough, and there was
some occasion for it, considering the number of
Spanish families of Jewish consanguinity as a consequence
of marriages between Christians and <i>conversos</i>&mdash;many
of these marriages having been contracted
between Castilians of good birth and the daughters of
wealthy baptized Jews. It is a decree that entirely
contradicts Pulgar’s assertion that Torquemada was of
Jewish extraction.</p>

<p>The appointment of Manrique as judge of appeal
was a very brief one, nor did it work satisfactorily and
accomplish what the Queen desired. In the following
August came another papal brief, stating that, notwithstanding
that appointment, fugitive New-Christians
from the Archbishopric of Seville continued to arrive
in Rome and to make their appeals to the Apostolic
Courts, protesting that they dared not address these
to the appointed tribunal in Seville, for fear of being
treated with excessive rigour.</p>

<p>Many stated that, by virtue of the ban against
them for having left the city, they were fearful of being
flung into prison unheard. Many, again, had already
been tried during their absence and burnt in effigy,
and they were apprehensive that if they returned their
appeals would be refused a hearing, and they would be
sent at once to the flames in execution of the sentence
already pronounced against them.</p>

<p>Therefore the Pope now ordered Manrique to
admit to reconciliation all who might seek it, in despite
of any judgment or sentence already passed upon them.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span></p>

<p>Had these commands prevailed, the destruction
wrought by the Inquisition would have been considerably
reduced, since none could have suffered but
the persistent apostate. The brief, however, does not
appear to have been even dispatched. No sooner was
its merciful decree indited than it was regretted and
retracted. Eleven days later Sixtus wrote to Ferdinand
acquainting him with the terms of that brief which had
been intended for Manrique, but explaining that these
had not been sufficiently considered, and that, therefore,
he was retaining it whilst fresh measures were
deliberated.</p>

<p>The position must have been growing intolerable
to the Sovereigns, for the Holy Office in Spain,
directed in this fashion from Rome, was governed by
unstable and ever-shifting elements that were eminently
disturbing to the State&mdash;particularly now that the
Inquisition was growing rapidly in importance. Therefore
Isabella wrote again, imploring the Holy Father
to give that institution a settled form. To this the
Pope acceded, perhaps himself aware of the necessity
for the thing requested. A head was necessary for
the consolidated institution it was now proposed to
form, and Frey Tom&aacute;s de Torquemada, from what
was known of his life, his character, and his ability,
was judged to be the man to fill this important office.
Accordingly he was recommended to Sixtus by the
Sovereigns, and he received his appointment from the
Pope, first as Grand Inquisitor for Castile, and soon
after (by the bull of October 17, 1483) his jurisdiction
was extended to include Aragon; so that he found
himself at the head of the Holy Office in Spain, and
invested with the fullest powers. It was his to elect,
depose, and replace subaltern inquisitors at his will,
and the jurisdiction of all those he appointed was
subject to and dependent upon himself.<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">80</a></p>

<p>Llorente says of him: “The result accredited the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
election. It seemed almost impossible that there
should be another man so capable of executing the
intentions of King Ferdinand to multiply confiscations,
the intentions of the Roman Curia to propagate its
jurisdiction and pecuniary maxims, and the intentions
of the projectors of the Inquisition and its Autos de
F&eacute; to inspire terror.”<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">81</a></p>

<p>With his elevation to that important position&mdash;a
position whose importance his own energy and determination
were to increase until his power in the land
should almost rival that of the Sovereigns themselves&mdash;the
Spanish Inquisition enters now upon a new
phase. Under the jurisdiction and control of that
stern-souled, mild-eyed ascetic, the entire character of
the Holy Office is transformed.</p>

<p>Immediately upon his appointment he set about
reconstituting it so that it should be in harmony with
the wishes of the Sovereigns. To assist him he
appointed as his assessors the jurisconsults Juan
Gutierrez de Lachaves and Tristan de Medina, and
he proceeded to establish four permanent tribunals:
one in Seville, under Morillo and San Martin, whom
he left undisturbed in their office, but subject to the
new rules which he laid down for the transaction of
affairs; one in Cordova, under Pedro Martinez de
Barrio and Anton Ruiz Morales, with Fr. Martin de
Caso as assessor; one in Jaen, under Juan Garcia
de Ca&ntilde;as and Fr. Juan de Yarza; and one in Villa
Real,<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">82</a> which shortly afterwards was transferred to
Toledo, under Francisco Sanchez de la Fuente and
Pedro Dias de Costana.</p>

<p>In addition to these he appointed other inquisitors
who, without being attached to any permanent tribunal,
were to proceed wherever he should direct them as
occasion arose to set up temporary courts.</p>

<p>In Toledo, Valladolid, Avila, Segovia, and other
cities there were inquisitors already of the Pope’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
appointing. Some of these failed to show the complete
submission to his orders which Torquemada demanded,
with the result that they were promptly deposed and
their places filled by others whom he nominated.
Those who manifested obedience to his rule he
confirmed in their appointments, but usually he sent
a nominee of his own to act in conjunction with them.</p>

<p>Torquemada himself remained at Court; for now
that the Inquisition was established upon its new
footing it became necessary that he should be in
constant communication with the Sovereigns for whom
he acted. Consultations were necessary on the score
of the measures to be taken for the administration
of what was rapidly become a corporation of great
importance in the realm. From this it presently
resulted that to the four royal councils already in
existence for the conduct of the affairs of the kingdom,
a fifth was added especially to deal with inquisitorial
matters. Whether the suggestion emanated from the
Sovereigns or from Torquemada, there are no means
of ascertaining, nor does it greatly signify.</p>

<p>This Supreme Council of the Inquisition was
established in 1484. It consisted of three royal
councillors: Alonso Carillo, Bishop of Mazzara,
Sancho Velasquez de Cuellar, and Poncio de Valencia,
all doctors of laws, and of Torquemada’s two assessors.
To preside over this “Suprema”&mdash;as the council
came to be called&mdash;Torquemada was appointed, thus
enormously increasing the power and influence which
already he wielded.</p>

<p>The three royal councillors had a definite vote in
all matters that appertained to the jurisdiction of the
Sovereigns; but in all matters of spiritual jurisdiction,
which was vested entirely in the Grand Inquisitor by
the papal bull, their votes were merely consultative&mdash;amounting
to no more than an expression of opinion.</p>

<p>It was Torquemada’s desire that his subordinates
should act with absolute uniformity in the discharge of
the duties entrusted to them, and that the courts of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
the Holy Office throughout Spain should one and all
be identical in their methods of procedure, the instruments
of his will and the expression of his conceptions.
With this end in view he summoned the inquisitors by
him appointed to the Tribunals of Seville, Cordova,
Jaen, and Villa Real to confer with him and his assessors
and the royal councillors.</p>

<p>The assembly took place in Seville on October 29,
and its business was the formulation of the first
instructions of Torquemada for the guidance of all
inquisitors.</p>

<p>In the library of the British Museum there is a
vellum-bound copy of the edition of this code, which
was subsequently published at Madrid in 1576.<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">83</a> It
contains, in addition to Torquemada’s articles of 1484
and subsequent years, others added by his successors,
and there are marginal notes giving the authorship of
each. The work is partly printed, partly in manuscript,
and a considerable number of pages remain in blank,
that further instructions may be filled in as the need
occurs. The printed matter is frequently underscored
by the pen of one or another of the inquisitors
through whose hands this copy passed during its active
existence.</p>

<p>The twenty-eight articles compiled by Torquemada
at the assembly of 1484, and constituting his first
“Instructions for the Governance of the Holy Office,”
demand a chapter to themselves.

<h2 id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X<br />

<span class="medium">THE JURISPRUDENCE OF THE HOLY OFFICE&mdash;THE FIRST
“INSTRUCTIONS” OF TORQUEMADA</span></h2>

<p>The first manual for the use of inquisitors was
probably written somewhere about 1320. It was
the work of the Dominican friar Bernard Gui&mdash;“Practica
Inquisitionis Heretice Pravitatis&mdash;Bernardo
Guidonis, Ordinis Fratrum Predicatorum”&mdash;and it
summarised the experience gathered during a hundred
years by the inquisitors of Southern France.</p>

<p>It is divided into five parts. The first three are
directly concerned with procedure, and the formul&aelig;
are given for every occasion&mdash;citation, arrest, pardon,
commutation, and sentence&mdash;with the fullest particulars
for the guidance of inquisitors. The fourth
part treats of the powers vested in the tribunal of
the Inquisition, and cites the authorities&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> the
decrees of pontiffs and of councils. The fifth part
surveys and defines the various heretical sects of
Gui’s day, gives particulars of the doctrines, rites,
and ceremonies by which each one may be known,
and lays down methods by which heretical guile may
be circumvented in examination.</p>

<p>The work was used by French inquisitors in
general and those of Toulouse in particular, and it
is more than probable that it inspired Nicolaus Eymeric
to compile his voluminous “Directorium Inquisitorum”
towards the middle of the fourteenth century.</p>

<p>Nicolaus Eymeric was Grand Inquisitor of Aragon,
and he prepared his directory, or manual of procedure,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
as a guide for his confr&egrave;res in the business
of prosecuting those guilty of heretical pravity.</p>

<p>The work circulated freely in its manuscript form,
and it was one of the first to be printed in Barcelona
upon the introduction of the printing-press, so that
in Torquemada’s day copies were widely diffused,
and were in the hands of all inquisitors in the world.</p>

<p>The bulk of the “Directorium” is little more than
a compilation. It is divided into three parts. The
first lays down the chief Articles of the Christian
Faith; the second is a collection of the decretals,
bulls, and briefs of the popes upon the subject of
heretics and heresies, and the decision of the various
councils held to determine matters connected with
heretics and their abettors, sorcerers, excommunicates,
Jews and infidels; the third part, which is Eymeric’s
own contribution to the subject, deals with the manner
in which trials should be conducted, and gives a
detailed list of the offences that come under the
jurisdiction of the Holy Office.</p>

<p>It may be well before proceeding further to give
a r&eacute;sum&eacute; of the grounds upon which the Inquisition
instituted proceedings, as set forth in the “Directorium.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>All heretics in general are subject to the animadversions
of the Holy Office; but there are, in
addition, certain offenders who, whilst not exactly guilty
of heresy, nevertheless render themselves justiciable
by the Inquisition. These are:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blasphemers</span> who in blaspheming say that which
is contrary to the Christian Faith. Thus, he who
says, “The season is so bad that God Himself could
not give us good weather,” sins upon a matter of
faith.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorcerers and Diviners</span>, when in their sorceries
they perform that which is in the nature of heresy&mdash;such
as re-baptizing infants, burning incense to a skull,
etc. But if they confine their sorceries to foretelling
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
the future by chiromancy or palmistry, by drawing the
short straw, or consulting the astrolabe, they are guilty
of simple sorcery, and it is for the secular courts to
prosecute them.</p>

<p>Amongst the latter are to be placed those who
administer love-philtres to women.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Devil-worshippers</span>: Those who invoke devils.
These are to be divided into three classes:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Those who worship the devil, sacrificing
to him, prostrating themselves, singing prayers
and fasting, burning incense or lighting candles
in his honour.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Those who confine themselves to offering
a <i>Dulie</i> or <i>Hyperdulie</i> cult to Satan, introducing
the names of devils into the litanies.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Those who invoke the devil by tracing
magic figures, placing an infant in a circle, using
a sword, a bed, or a mirror, etc.</p></blockquote>

<p>In general it is easy to recognize those who have
dealings with devils on account of their ferocious
aspect and terrible air.</p>

<p>The invocation in any of the three manners cited
is always a heresy. But if the devil should only be
asked to do things that are of his office&mdash;such as to
tempt a woman to the sin of luxury&mdash;provided that
this is done without adoration or prayer, but in terms
of command, there are authors who hold that in such
cases the person so proceeding is not guilty of heresy.</p>

<p>Amongst those who invoke devils are astrologers
and alchymists, who when they do not succeed in
making the discoveries they seek never fail to have
recourse to the devil, sacrificing to him and invoking
him expressly or tacitly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jews and Infidels</span>: The first when they sin
against their religion in any of the articles of faith
that are the same with them as with us&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> that are
common alike to Jew and to Christian&mdash;or when they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
attack dogmas that are, similarly, common to both
creeds.</p>

<p>As for infidels, the Church and the Pope, and
consequently the Inquisition, may punish them when
they sin against the laws of nature&mdash;the only laws
they know.</p>

<p>Jews and infidels who attempt to pervert Christians
are also regarded as abettors or <i>fautores</i>.</p>

<p>In spite of the prohibition to succour a heretic,
a man would not be regarded as an abettor who gave
food to a heretic dying of hunger, since it is possible
that if spared the latter might yet come to be converted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Excommunicates</span> who remain in excommunication
during a whole year, by which are to be understood
not merely those who are excommunicate as heretics,
or abettors of heretics, but excommunicate upon any
grounds whatsoever. In fact, the indifference to
excommunication renders them suspect of heresy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Apostates.</span>&mdash;Apostate Christians who become Jews
or Mohammedans (these religions not being heresies),
even though they should have apostatized through
fear of death. The fear of torture or death not being
one that can touch a person who is firm in the Faith,
no apostasy is to be excused upon such grounds.<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">84</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>With the “Directorium” of Eymeric before him,
Torquemada set to work to draw up the first articles
of his famous code. Additions were to be made to
it later, as the need for such additions came to be
shown by experience; but no subsequent addition
was of the importance of these original twenty-eight
articles. They may be said to have given the jurisprudence
of the Spanish Inquisition a settled form,
which continued practically unchanged for over three
hundred years after Torquemada’s death.</p>

<p>A survey of these articles and of the passages from
Eymeric that have a bearing upon them, together with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
some of the annotations of the scholiast Francesco
Pegna,<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">85</a> should serve to convey some notion of the
jurisprudence of the Holy Office and of the extraordinary
spirit that inspired and governed it&mdash;a spirit
at once crafty and stupid, subtle and obvious, saintly
and diabolical, consistent in nothing&mdash;not even in
cruelty, for in its warped and dreadful way it accounted
itself merciful, and not only represented but believed
that its aims were charitable. It practised its abominations
of cruelty out of love for the human race,
to save the human race from eternal damnation; and
whilst it wept on the one hand over the wretched
heretic it flung to the flames, it exulted on the other
in the thought that by burning one who was smitten
with the pestilence of heresy it saved perhaps a
hundred from infection and from purging that infection
in an eternity of hell-fire.</p>

<p>They are rash who see hypocrisy in the priestly
code that is to follow. Hypocrites there may have
been, there must have been, and many; such a system
was a very hotbed of hypocrisy. Yet the system itself
was not hypocritical. It was sincere, dreadfully,
tragically, ardently sincere, with the most hopeless,
intolerable, and stupid of all sincerity&mdash;the sincerity
of fanaticism, which destroys all sense of proportion,
and distorts man’s intellectual vision until with an easy
conscience he makes of guile and craft and falsehood
the principles that shall enable him to do what he
conceives to be his duty by his fellow-man.</p>

<p>The doctrine of exclusive salvation was the source
of all this evil. But that doctrine was firmly and
sincerely held. Torquemada or any other inquisitor
might have uttered the words which an inspired poet
has caused to fall from the lips of Philip II.:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“The blood and sweat of heretics at the stake<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Is God’s best dew upon the barren field.”<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">86</a><br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span></p>

<p>And he would have uttered them with a calm and
firm conviction, assured that he did no more than
proclaim an obvious truth which might serve him as a
guide to do his duty by man and God. For all that
he did he could find a commandment in the Scriptures.
Was burning the proper death for heretics? He
answered the question out of the very mouth of Christ,
as you shall see. Should a heretic’s property be
confiscated? Eymeric and Paramo point to the
expulsion of Adam and Eve from Eden as a consequence
of their disobedience&mdash;the first of all heresies&mdash;and
ask you what was that but confiscation. Is it
proper to impose a garment of shame upon those
convicted of lesser heresies, or upon penitents who are
reconciled? Paramo will answer you that Adam and
Eve wore skins after their fall, and implies that this is
a proper precedent for the infamous <i>sanbenito</i>.</p>

<p>And so on: Moses, David, John the Baptist, and
the gentle Saviour Himself are made to afford reason
for this course and for that, as the need arises, and
each reason is more grotesque than the other, until
you are stunned by the blows of these clumsy arguments.
You cease to wonder that the translation of
the Bible was forbidden, that its study was inhibited.
If those who were learned in theology could interpret
it so extravagantly, what might not the unlearned
achieve?</p>

<p>But let us pass on to the consideration of Torquemada’s
code.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Article I</span></h3>

<blockquote>

<p>Whenever inquisitors are appointed to a diocese, city,
village, or other place which hitherto has had no inquisitors,
they shall&mdash;after having presented the warrants by which
they are empowered to the prelate of the principal church
and to the governor of the district&mdash;summon by proclamation
all the people and convoke the clergy. They shall appoint
a Sunday or holiday upon which all are to assemble in the
cathedral or principal church to hear a sermon of the Faith.</p>

<p>They shall contrive that this sermon is delivered by a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
good preacher or by one of the actual inquisitors, as they
deem best. Its aim shall be to expound the capacity in which
they are there, their powers, and their intentions.</p></blockquote>

<p>Upon the conclusion of this sermon the inquisitors shall
order all faithful Christians to come forward and make oath
upon the Cross and the Gospels to favour the Holy Inquisition
and its ministers, and to offer them no impediment
directly or indirectly in the prosecution of their mission.</p>

<p>This oath shall be specially imposed upon the governors
or other justiciaries of the place, and it shall be witnessed by
the notaries of the inquisitors.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Article II</span></h3>

<blockquote>

<p>After the conclusion of the said sermon the inquisitors
shall order to be read and published an admonition with
censures against those who are rebellious or who contest the
power of the Holy Office.</p></blockquote>

<h3><span class="smcap">Article III</span></h3>

<blockquote>

<p>After the conclusion of the said sermon the inquisitors
shall publish an edict granting a term of grace, of thirty or
forty days&mdash;as they may deem proper&mdash;so that all persons
who have fallen into the sin of heresy or apostasy, who have
observed Jewish rites or any other that are contrary to the
Christian Religion, may come forward to confess their sins,
assured that if they do so with a sincere penitence, divulging
all that is known to them or that they remember, not only of
their own sins but also of the sins of others, they shall be
received with charity.</p>

<p>They shall be subjected to a salutary penance, but they
shall not suffer death, imprisonment, or confiscation of their
property, nor shall they in any way be mulcted unless the
inquisitors, in consideration of the quality of the penitents and
of the sins they confess, should think well to impose some
pecuniary penance upon them.</p>

<p>Concerning this grace and mercy that their Highnesses
consider well to accord to those who are reconciled, the
Sovereigns order the delivery of letters-patent, bearing the
royal seal, whose tenor shall be included in the published
edict.</p></blockquote>

<p>It is sufficiently plain, from the terms of this
article, that the edict of grace was published by royal
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
command, and that it was not, as Garcia Rodrigo
represents it, a merciful dispensation spontaneously
emanating from the Holy Office.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Article IV</span></h3>

<blockquote>

<p>Self-delators shall present their confessions in writing to
the inquisitors and their notaries with two or three witnesses
who shall be officers of the Inquisition or other upright
persons.</p>

<p>Upon receipt of this confession by the inquisitors, let the
oath be administered to the penitents in legal form, not only
concerning the matters confessed but concerning others that
may be known to them and upon which they may be questioned.
Let them be asked how long it is since they Judaized
or otherwise sinned against the Faith, and how long it is since
they abandoned their false beliefs, repented, and ceased to
observe those ceremonies. Next let them be examined upon
the circumstances of the matters confessed, that the inquisitors
may satisfy themselves that these confessions are true.
Especially let them be questioned as to what prayers they
recite, where they recite them, and with whom they have
been in the habit of assembling to hear the law of Moses
preached.</p></blockquote>

<h3><span class="smcap">Article V</span></h3>

<blockquote>

<p>Self-delators who seek reconciliation to Holy Mother
Church shall be required publicly to abjure their errors, and
penance shall publicly be imposed upon them at the discretion
of the inquisitors, using mercy and kindness as far
as it is possible for them to do so with an easy conscience.</p>

<p>The inquisitors shall admit none to secret penance and
recantation unless his sin shall have been so secret that none
else knows or could know of it save his confessor; such a
one all inquisitors may reconcile and absolve in secret.</p></blockquote>

<p>Llorente says that the admission to secret penance
was a source of much gold to the Roman Curia, as
thousands appealed to the Pope offering a secret
confession and firm purpose of amendment if secretly
absolved, for which a papal brief was necessary.</p>

<p>A word must here be said on the score of <small>ABJURATION</small>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
It was the amende provided by Eymeric<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">87</a> for
those who by their speech or conduct should have
fallen into suspicion of heresy; those, for instance,
who abstained from the sacraments imposed by Mother
Church being liable to this suspicion.</p>

<p>There were three degrees of suspicion into which
a man might fall: light, vehement, and violent. The
abjuration required was practically the same in all
three cases, but the punishment imposed upon the
abjurer varied according to the degree. This abjuration
must be publicly made in church before the
assembled people, the suspects being placed&mdash;like all
penitents or convicts of heresy&mdash;upon a raised platform
in full view of the assembled faithful. The
inquisitor would read out the Articles of the Christian
Faith, and a list of the principal errors against it,
laying particular stress upon those errors of which
the penitents were suspected, and which they were
required to abjure with both hands upon the Gospels,
and according to the formula laid down by Eymeric.</p>

<p>Those who are suspected lightly (<i>leviter</i>) are admonished
that should they again fall into error they
will be abandoned to the secular arm for punishment.
With that admonition, and the imposition of a penance
which may take the form of fasts, prayers, or pilgrimages,
they are dismissed.</p>

<p>Those suspected vehemently (<i>vehementer</i>) are
similarly admonished, but in addition they may be
sent to prison for a time, whereafter they must undergo
a heavy penance, such as standing on certain days
at the door of the principal church or near the altar
during the celebration of Mass holding a candle&mdash;but
not wearing a <i>sanbenito</i>, as, properly speaking,
they are not heretics&mdash;or they may be sent upon a
pilgrimage.</p>

<p>He who is violently suspected (<i>violenter</i>) shall be
absolved of the excommunication incurred, but as his
crime may not go unpunished, and to the end that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
he may suffer less severely in the next world, he is
sentenced to a term of imprisonment, whereafter he
shall be condemned to stand at the church door during
the great feasts of the year wearing the penitential
scapulary known as the <i>sanbenito</i>, that all may be
made aware of his infamy.</p>

<p>After passing sentence, the inquisitor shall admonish
the penitent in these terms:</p>

<p>“My dear Son, be patient and do not despair; if
we observe in you the signs of contrition we shall
soften your penance; but beware of departing from
what we have prescribed for you; should you do so
you shall be punished as an impenitent heretic.”</p>

<p>The punishment for the impenitent was, of course,
the fire.</p>

<p>The inquisitor shall conclude the ceremony by
granting an indulgence of forty days to all who have
attended it and an indulgence of three years to
those who shall have taken part in it.</p>

<p>The sentence of prison, with its bread-and-water
diet, might be relaxed; but never that of the <i>sanbenito</i>,
which is considered by Eymeric&mdash;and inquisitors
generally&mdash;as the most salutary of penances for him
that undergoes it and the most edifying to the public
generally.</p>

<p>The self-delators admitted by Torquemada to
abjuration were treated as suspects of the first degree&mdash;<i>leviter</i>.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Article VI</span></h3>

<blockquote>

<p>Inasmuch as heretics and apostates (although they return
to the Catholic Faith and become reconciled) are infamous at
law, and inasmuch as they must perform their penances
with humility and sorrow for having lapsed into error, the
inquisitors shall order them not to hold any public office
or ecclesiastical benefice, and they shall not be lawyers or
brokers, apothecaries, surgeons or physicians, nor shall they
wear gold or silver, coral, pearls, precious stones or other
ornaments, nor dress in silk or camlett, nor go on horseback
nor carry weapons all their lives, under pain of being deemed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
relapsed (<i>relapsos</i>) into heresy, as must all be considered who
after reconciliation do not carry out the penances imposed
upon them.</p></blockquote>

<p>This decree was no more than the revival of the
enactment made a century and a half earlier by
Alfonso XI in the code known as the Partidas, which
had mercifully been allowed to fall into desuetude. It
was, Llorente tells us, a considerable source of wealth
to the Roman Curia. Frequent appeals for “rehabilitation”
were made in consequence, and accorded under
an apostolic brief whose heavy charges the appellants
were required to defray.</p>

<p>Torquemada mercifully stops short of ordering the
self-delators to wear the <i>sanbenito</i>. Even so, however,
by decreeing that they must wear no garments
of silk or wool, and therefore none but the very
plainest raiment, unadorned by any precious metal or
jewel&mdash;not to mention the prohibition to use weapons
or go on horseback&mdash;he imposed upon them a garb
that was only some degrees removed from the penitential
sack and served the same purpose of marking
them out for infamy.</p>

<p>The wearing of the <i>sanbenito</i>, too, was a custom
that had fallen somewhat into desuetude. But the
ascetic Torquemada was not the man to allow a form
of penance accounted so very salutary to continue
neglected. He revived and extended the use of it,
adding innovations of his own, so that it came to be
imposed not only upon condemned heretics, but upon
the reconciled&mdash;other than self-delators&mdash;and upon suspects,
who were required to wear it during the abjuration
ceremony.</p>

<p>This odious garment, its origin and history, shall
presently be more fully considered.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Article VII</span></h3>

<blockquote>

<p>As the crime of heresy is a very heinous one, it is desired
that the reconciled may realize by the penances imposed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
upon them how gravely they have offended and sinned
against Our Lord Jesus Christ. Yet, as it is our aim to
treat them very mercifully and kindly, pardoning them from
the pain of fire and perpetual imprisonment, and leaving
them all their property should they, as has been said, come
to confess their errors within the appointed time of grace,
the inquisitors shall, in addition to the penances imposed
upon the said reconciled, order them to bestow as alms a
certain portion of their property, according to the position
of the penitent and the gravity of the crimes confessed.
These pecuniary penances shall be applied for the Holy War
which the most serene Sovereigns are making upon the
Moors of Granada, enemies of our Holy Catholic Faith, and
to other pious works that may be undertaken. For just as
the said heretics and apostates have offended against Our
Lord and His Holy Faith, so, after re-incorporation in the
Church, it is just that they should bear pecuniary penances
for the defence of the Holy Faith.</p>

<p>These pecuniary penances shall be at the discretion of the
inquisitors; but they shall be guided by the tariff given
them by the Reverend Father Prior of Holy Cross (<i>i.e.</i> by
Torquemada).</p></blockquote>

<p>It was no inconsiderable proportion of their property
that was required of them, as may be seen from
the penance of “alms” for the war against Granada
imposed upon those who were reconciled in Toledo
two years later; one-fifth of their property being
demanded.<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">88</a></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Article VIII</span></h3>

<blockquote>

<p>Should any person guilty of the said crime of heresy fail
to present himself within the appointed period of grace, but
come forward voluntarily after its expiry and make his
confession in due form before having been arrested or cited
by the inquisitors, or before the inquisitors shall have received
testimony against him, such person shall be received
to abjuration and reconciliation in the same manner as
those who presented themselves during the term of the said
edict, and he shall be submitted to penances at the discretion
of the inquisitors. But such penances shall not be pecuniary
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
because his property is confiscate [<i>so that his admission to
abjuration is not quite upon the same terms</i>].</p>

<p>But if at the time of his coming to confess and seek
reconciliation, the inquisitors should already be informed by
witnesses of his heresy or apostasy, or should already have
cited him to appear before the Court to answer the charge,
in such a case the inquisitor shall receive the penitent to
reconciliation&mdash;if he entirely confesses his own errors and
what he knows of the errors of others&mdash;and shall impose
upon him heavier penances than upon the former, even up to
perpetual imprisonment should the case demand it.</p></blockquote>

<p>This is merely one of those quibbles that permeate
this jurisprudence. The article in this last respect
is so framed as to make it appear that under such
circumstances the inquisitors would be acting more
mercifully than against an accused heretic; but the
latitude of punishment is such that they need display
no such mercy&mdash;perpetual imprisonment being the
punishment prescribed for any heretic (who is not
“relapsed”) seeking reconciliation.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>But no persons who shall come to confess after expiry of
the period of grace shall be subjected to pecuniary penances&mdash;unless
their Highnesses should mercifully condescend to
remit all or portion of the confiscation incurred by those so
reconciled.</p></blockquote>

<p>This last clause seems rather in the nature of
a provision against any merciful weakness on the
Sovereigns’ part.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Article IX</span></h3>

<blockquote>

<p>If any children of heretics having fallen into the sin of
heresy by indoctrination of their parents, and being under
twenty years of age, should come to seek reconciliation and
to confess the errors they know of themselves, their parents
and any other persons, even though they should come after
the expiry of the term of grace, the inquisitors shall receive
them kindly, imposing penances lighter than upon others in
like case, and they shall contrive that these children be tutored
in the Faith and the Sacraments of Holy Mother Church,
as they are to be excused upon the grounds of age and
education.</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span></p>

<p>They are not, however, to be excused to the extent
of enjoying any of their parents’ property. That is
confiscate by virtue of the parents’ heresy; and by
virtue of that same heresy on the part of their parents
these children and their own children must remain
under the ban of infamy, inhibited from wearing gold
or silver, etc., and from holding any office under the
crown or any ecclesiastical benefice. It seems almost
ironical to talk of imposing light penances upon
wretches who are automatically subject to such
penalties as these. But by that “light penance”
Llorente conceives would be meant their wearing a
<i>sanbenito</i> for a couple of years, appearing in it at
Mass and being paraded in it in processions.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Article X</span></h3>

<blockquote>

<p>Persons guilty of heresy and apostasy, by the fact of their
having fallen into these sins, incur the loss of all their
property and the administration of it, counting from the
day when first they offended, and their said property is
confiscate to their Highnesses’ treasury. But in the matter
of ecclesiastical pains in the case of those reconciled, the
inquisitors in pronouncing upon them shall declare them to
be heretics, apostates, or observers of the rites and ceremonies
of the Jews; but that since they seek conversion with
a pure heart and true faith, and they are ready to bear
the penances that may be imposed, they shall be absolved
and reconciled to Holy Mother Church.</p></blockquote>

<p>The object of this article is really to make the act
of confiscation retrospective where necessary, so as to
circumvent any who should attempt, by alienation
of his property, to avoid its confiscation. Since the
confiscation was incurred upon the date of the first
offence against the Faith, the inquisitors were to
trace any property that might subsequently have
been disposed of by the delinquent, and even should
it have gone to the paying of debts or the endowment
of a daughter married to one who was an old and
“clean” Christian, the Holy Office must seize and
confiscate it to the Royal Treasury.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Article XI</span></h3>

<blockquote>

<p>If any heretic or apostate who shall have been arrested
upon information laid against him should say that he desires
reconciliation and confess all his faults, what Jewish ceremonies
he may have observed, and what is known to him
of the faults of others, entirely and without reservations,
the inquisitors shall admit him to reconciliation subject to
perpetual imprisonment as by law prescribed. But should
the inquisitors, in conjunction with the diocesan ordinary,
in view of the contrition of the offender and the quality of
his confession, think well to commute this penance to another
lighter one, they shall have faculty so to do.</p>

<p>It seems that this should take place chiefly if the heretic
at the first sitting of the court, or upon his first appearance
before it, without awaiting the declaration of his offences,
should announce his desire to confess and abjure; and such
confession should be made before there is any publication of
witnesses or of the matters urged by them against him.</p></blockquote>

<h3><span class="smcap">Article XII</span></h3>

<blockquote>

<p>Should the prosecution of an accused have been conducted
to the point of the publication of witnesses and their depositions,
but should he then confess his faults and beg to be
admitted to reconciliation, desiring formally to abjure his
errors, the inquisitors shall receive him to the said reconciliation
subject to perpetual imprisonment, to which they shall
sentence him&mdash;save if in view of his contrition and other
attendant circumstances the inquisitors should have cause to
consider that the reconciliation of such a heretic is simulated;
in such case they must declare him an impenitent heretic and
abandon him to the secular arm: all of which is left to the
conscience of the inquisitors.</p></blockquote>

<p>“Abandonment to the secular arm” is, as shall
presently be considered, the ecclesiastical equivalent
to a sentence of death by fire.</p>

<p>The term “publication of witnesses” must not be
accepted literally. What it really meant will become
clear upon reading Article XVI, which was specially
framed by Torquemada to modify and limit this
time-honoured custom of civil and ecclesiastical courts.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Article XIII</span></h3>

<blockquote>

<p>If any of those who are reconciled during the period of
grace or after its expiry should fail to confess all their own
sins and all that they know of the sins of others, especially in
grave cases, and should such omission arise not from forgetfulness
but from malice, as may afterwards be proved by
witnesses, since it is clear that the said reconciled have
perjured themselves, and it must be presumed that their
reconciliation was simulated, although they may have been
absolved let them be proceeded against as impenitent heretics
as soon as the said fiction and perjury are discovered.</p>

<p>Similarly if any person reconciled at the time of the edict
of grace or afterwards, shall boast himself in public in such
a manner that this can be proved, saying that he did not
commit the sins to which he confessed, he must be deemed
impenitent and a simulated convert, and the inquisitors shall
proceed against him as if he were not reconciled.</p></blockquote>

<h3><span class="smcap">Article XIV</span></h3>

<blockquote>

<p>If any, upon being denounced and convicted of the sin of
heresy, shall deny and persist in his denial until sentence is
passed, and the said crime shall have been proved against
him, although the accused should confess the Catholic Faith
and assert that he has always been and is a Christian, the
inquisitors must declare him a heretic and so sentence him,
for juridically the crime is proved, and by refusing to confess
his error the convict does not permit the Church to absolve
him and use him mercifully.</p>

<p>But in such cases the inquisitors should proceed with
great care in their examination of the witnesses, closely cross-questioning
them, gathering information on the score of their
characters, and ascertaining whether there exist motives why
they should depone out of hatred or ill-will towards the
prisoner.</p></blockquote>

<h3><span class="smcap">Article XV</span></h3>

<blockquote>

<p>If the said crime of heresy or apostasy is half-proven
(<i>semiplenamente provado</i>) the inquisitors may deliberate
upon putting the accused to the torture, and if under torture
he should confess his sin, he must ratify his confession on
one of the following three days. If he does so ratify he shall
be punished as convicted of heresy; if he does not ratify, but
revokes his confession as the crime is neither fully proved
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
nor yet disproved, the inquisitors must order, on account of
the infamy and presumption of guilt of the accused, that
he should publicly abjure his error; or the inquisitors may
repeat the torture.</p></blockquote>

<p>There is nothing in this article that may be considered
as a departure from or an enlargement upon
any of the rules laid down by Eymeric in his
“Directorium,” as we shall see when we come to
deal with this gruesome subject of torture.</p>

<p>It is urged by apologists that, when all is said, the
torture to which the inquisitors had recourse, and,
similarly, the punishment of death by fire, were not
peculiarly ecclesiastical institutions; that they were
the ordinary civil methods of dealing with offenders,
and that in adopting them the Church had simply conformed,
as was her custom, with that which was by
law prescribed.</p>

<p>It is quite true that originally these were the
methods by which the secular tribunals proceeded
against those who sinned against the Faith. But it
must also be borne in mind that if the civil authorities
so proceeded they implicitly obeyed the bull “ad
extirpanda” of Sixtus IV, which imposed this duty
upon them under pain of excommunication.</p>

<p>Owing to the inconvenience that attended this
procedure in so far as torture and questions upon
matters of Faith were concerned, it was later accounted
desirable that the inquisitors themselves
should take charge of it. They were enjoined, however,
to see to it that there should be no shedding of
blood or loss of life, since it was against the Christian
maxims that a priest should be guilty of such things.
So that when by misadventure it happened that blood
was shed or a patient died under the hands of the
torturers, the inquisitor conducting the examination
became guilty of an irregularity. For this he must
seek absolution at the hands of a brother cleric; and
the inquisitors were informed&mdash;to make matters easier
for them and to spare them anxieties in this matter&mdash;that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
they had the right to absolve one another under
such circumstances.</p>

<p>But even if we fully admit that the use of torture&mdash;and
similarly of fire&mdash;had been secular institutions of
which the Church had simply availed herself as the
only methods that commended themselves in such an
age, it must still be held against the inquisitors that
these methods were by no means tempered or softened
in their priestly hands.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Article XVI</span></h3>

<blockquote>

<p>It being held that the publication of the names of witnesses
who depone upon the crime of heresy might result in great
harm and danger to the persons and property of the said
witnesses&mdash;since it is known that many have been wounded
and killed by heretics&mdash;it is resolved that the accused shall not
be supplied with a copy of the depositions against him, but
that he shall be informed of what is declared in them, whilst
such circumstances as might lead to the identification of the
deponents shall be withheld.</p>

<p>But the inquisitors must, when proof has been obtained
from the examination of the witnesses, publish these depositions,
withholding always the names and such circumstances
as might enable the accused to learn the identity of the
witnesses; and the inquisitors may give the accused a
copy of the publication in such form [<i>i.e.</i> truncated] if he
requires it.</p>

<p>If the accused should demand the services of an advocate,
he shall be supplied. The advocate must make formal oath
that he will faithfully assist the accused, but that if at any
stage of the pleadings he shall realize that justice is not on
his side, he shall at once cease to assist the delinquent and
shall inform the inquisitors of the circumstance.</p>

<p>The accused shall pay out of his own property, if he have
any, the services of the advocate; if he have no property, then
the advocate shall be paid out of other confiscations, such
being the pleasure of their Highnesses.</p></blockquote>

<p>It is extremely doubtful if a more flagrant departure
from all the laws of equity would be possible than that
which is embodied in Torquemada’s enactment on the
subject of witnesses.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span></p>

<p>The notion of an accused hearing nothing of what
is deposed against him, of his not even being informed
of the full extent of such depositions nor yet confronted
with his accusers, is beyond a doubt one of the most
monstrously unjust features of this tribunal. And by
taking the fullest advantage of that enactment and
reducing the proceedings to a secrecy such as was
never known in any court, the inquisitors were able to
inspire a terror which was even greater than that
occasioned by the fires they fed with human fuel at
their frequent Autos.</p>

<p>Torquemada based this enactment upon the caution
laid down by Eymeric on the score of divulging the
names of witnesses. But Eymeric went no further
than to say that these names should be suppressed
where a possibility of danger to the delators lay in
their being divulged. The accused, however, might
have the full record of the proceedings read to him,
and he might infer for himself who were his accusers.
There was no question in Eymeric of any truncations.</p>

<p>Torquemada’s aim is perfectly clear. It was not
based, as is said in the article, upon concern for any
danger that the delators might incur. For, after all, it
shall be made plain before we conclude the survey of
inquisitorial jurisprudence, that the wounding or even
the death of those witnesses would be regarded (professedly,
at least) as an enviable thing; they would be
suffering for the Faith, and thus qualifying for the
immortal crown of martyrdom. Rather was Torquemada’s
object to remove all fear that might trammel
delators and stifle delations. The delator must be
protected solely to the end that other delators might
come forward with confidence to inform against secret
heretics and apostates, so that the activities of the
Holy Office should suffer no curtailment.</p>

<p>Trasmiera, a later inquisitor, in the course of an
eulogium of secrecy, speaks of it as “the pole upon
which the government of the Inquisition is balanced,
calling for the veneration of the faithful; it facilitates
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
the delations of witnesses, and it is the support and
foundation of this tribunal; once deprived of it, the
architecture of the edifice must undoubtedly give
way.”<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">89</a></p>

<p>The clause relating to advocates is founded upon
the ancient ecclesiastical law which forbade an advocate
to plead for heretics. His being enlisted under the
present clause would clearly serve to increase the peril
of the accused.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Article XVII</span></h3>

<blockquote>

<p>The inquisitors shall, themselves, examine the witnesses,
and not leave such examinations to their notaries or others,
unless a witness should be ill or unable to come before
the inquisitor and the inquisitor similarly unable to go to the
witness, in which case he may send the ordinary ecclesiastical
judge of the district with another upright person and a notary
to take the depositions.</p></blockquote>

<h3><span class="smcap">Article XVIII</span></h3>

<blockquote>

<p>When any person is put to the torture the inquisitors and
the ordinary should be present&mdash;or, at least, some of them.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
But when this is for any reason impossible, then the person
entrusted to question should be a learned and faithful man
(<i>hombre entendido y fiel</i>).</p></blockquote>

<h3><span class="smcap">Article XIX</span></h3>

<blockquote>

<p>to the door of the church of the district to which he belongs,
and after thirty days’ grace the inquisitors may proceed to try
him as contumaciously absent. If there is sufficient evidence
of his guilt, sentence may be passed upon him. Or, if evidence
is insufficient, he may be branded a suspect and commanded&mdash;as
is due of suspects&mdash;to present himself for canonical purgation.
Should he fail to do so within the time appointed, his
guilt must be presumed.</p>

<p>Proceedings against the absent may be taken in any of
the following three ways:</p>

<p>(1) In accordance with the chapter “Cum contumatia de
hereticis,” citing the accused to appear and defend himself
upon certain matters concerning the Faith and certain sins of
heresy, under pain of excommunication; if he does not respond,
he shall be denounced as a rebel, and if he persists
in this rebellion for one year he shall be declared a formal
heretic. This is the safest and least rigorous course to adopt.</p>

<p>(2) Should it seem to the inquisitors that a crime against
any absent can be established, let him be cited by edict to
come and prove his innocence within thirty days&mdash;or a longer
period may be conceded if such is necessary to permit him to
return from wherever he may be known to be. And he shall
be cited at every stage of the proceedings until the passing of
sentence, when, should he still be absent, let him be accused of
rebellion, and should the crime be proved he may be condemned
in his absence without further delay.</p>

<p>(3) If in the course of inquisitorial proceedings there is
presumption of heresy against an absent person (although the
crime is not clearly proved) the inquisitors may summon him
by edict commanding him to appear within a given time to
clear himself canonically of the said error, on the understanding
that should he fail to appear, or, appearing, should fail to
clear himself, he shall be deemed convicted and the inquisitors
shall proceed to act as by law prescribed.</p>

<p>The inquisitors, being learned and discriminating, will
select the course that seems most certain and is most practical
under the particular circumstances of the case.</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span></p>

<p>Any person condemned as contumacious became
an outlaw, whom it was lawful for any man to kill.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Canonical Purgation</span>, which is mentioned in this
article, differs considerably from <span class="smcap">Abjuration</span>, and the
difference must be indicated.</p>

<p>It is applicable only to those who are accused by
the public voice&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> who have acquired the “reputation”
of heresy&mdash;without yet having been detected in
any act or speech that might cause them to be suspected
of heresy in any of the defined degrees of such suspicion.</p>

<p>It almost amounts to a distinction without a difference,
and is an excellent instance of the almost laboured
equity in which this tribunal indulged in matters of detail
whilst flagrantly outraging equity in the main issues.</p>

<p>For Canonical Purgation, says Eymeric,<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">90</a> the
accused must find a certain number of sureties or
<i>compurgatores</i>, the number required being governed
by the gravity of the (alleged) offence. They must be
persons of integrity and of the same station in life as
the accused, with whom they must have been acquainted
for some years. The accused shall make oath upon
the Gospels that he has never held or taught the
heresies stated, and the <i>compurgatores</i> shall swear to
their belief that this is the truth. This Purgation
must be made in all cities where the accused has been
defamed.</p>

<p>The accused shall be given a certain time in which
to find his <i>compurgatores</i>, and should he fail to find the
number required he shall at once be convicted and
condemned as a heretic.</p>

<p>And Pegna adds, in his commentary upon this, that
any who shall be found guilty of heresy after having once
been in this position is to be regarded as a “relapso”
and delivered to the secular arm. For this reason he
enjoins that Canonical Purgation should not lightly be
ordered, as it is so largely dependent upon the will of
third parties.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span></p>

<p>Eymeric adds, further, that sometimes Canonical
Purgation may be ordered to those who are defamed
by the public voice but who are not in the hands of
the inquisitors. Should they refuse to surrender, the
inquisitors shall proceed to excommunicate them, and
if they persist in their excommunication for one year
they shall be deemed heretics, and subject to the
penalties entailed by such a sentence.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Article XX</span></h3>

<blockquote>

<p>If any writings or trials should bring to light the heresy
of a person deceased, let proceedings be taken against him&mdash;even
though forty years shall have elapsed since the offence&mdash;let
the fiscal accuse him before the tribunal, and if he should
be found guilty the body must be exhumed.</p>

<p>His children or heirs may appear to defend him; but
should they fail to appear, or, appearing, fail to establish his
innocence, sentence shall be passed upon him and his property
confiscated.</p></blockquote>

<p>It will, of course, be obvious that since no good
or useful purpose could be served by instituting proceedings
against the dead, nothing but cupidity can
have inspired so barbarous a decree as this. The
avowed object of the Inquisition&mdash;and very loudly
and insistently avowed&mdash;was the uprooting of heresies
to prevent their spread, and the inquisitors maintained
that it was a painful necessity thrust upon them by
their duty to God to destroy those who persisted in
heresy, lest these, by their teaching and example,
should contaminate and imperil the souls of others.
Thus the Inquisition justified itself, and removed all
doubt as to the purity of its motives.</p>

<p>But how should this justification apply to the trial
of the dead&mdash;even though they should have been dead
for over forty years?</p>

<p>The provision, however, was not Torquemada’s own.
He followed in the footsteps of earlier inquisitors.
He found his precedent in the 120th question propounded
by Eymeric&mdash;“Confiscatio bonorum h&aelig;retici
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
fieri potest post ejus mortem.” In this the author of
the “Directorium” lays it down that although in civil law
legal action against a criminal ceases with his death,
such is not to be the case where heresy is concerned,
on account of the enormity of the crime. (It may
seem that, had he been quite honest, he would have said,
“on account of the profits that may accrue from
the prosecution.”)</p>

<p>Heretics, he pursues, may be proceeded against
after their death, and, if convicted, their property may
be confiscated&mdash;and this within forty years of their
decease&mdash;depriving the heirs of all enjoyment of it,
even though the third generation should be in
possession.</p>

<p>All that Torquemada did was to extend the term
of procedure beyond the forty years to which Eymeric
had limited it.</p>

<p>And to the foregoing Eymeric adds that, should
the heirs at any time have acquired knowledge that
the deceased was a heretic, they shall be censured for
having acted in bad faith and kept the matter secret!
By this he actually puts it upon men to come forward
voluntarily and accuse their dead fathers or grandfathers
of heretical practices, to the end that they
themselves may be rendered destitute and infamous
to the extent of being incapacitated from holding any
public office or following any honourable profession&mdash;and
this though they themselves should be the most
faithful of Catholics, untouched by the faintest breath
of suspicion!</p>

<p>It is beyond words a monstrous and inequitable
enactment. Yet, like all else, they can justify it. If
there is one thing in which the inquisitors were truly
admirable, it is in the deftness with which they could
justify and reconcile with their conscience the most
inhuman practice. They would answer questions as
to the lawfulness of this proceeding by urging that
they did it with the greatest reluctance, but that their
duty demanded it to the end that the living should
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
beware how they failed in fidelity to the Faith, lest
punishment should overtake them in their descendants
after they themselves had passed beyond the reach of
human justice. Thus would they represent the act as
salutary and to the advantage of the Faith. And
since there is at least a scintilla of truth in this, who
shall say that they did not tranquillize their consciences
and delude themselves that the confiscations
were a mere incident which nowise swayed their
judgment?</p>

<p>That proceedings against persons deceased were
by no means rare is shown by the frequent records of
corpses burnt&mdash;one of the purposes for which they
were exhumed; the other being that they must cease
to defile consecrated ground.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Article XXI</span></h3>

<blockquote>

<p>The Sovereigns desiring that inquisition be made alike
in the domains of the nobles as in the lands under the
Crown, inquisitors shall proceed to effect these, and shall
require the lords of such domains to make oath to comply
with all that the law ordains, and to lend all assistance to
the inquisitors. Should they decline to do so, they shall be
proceeded against as by law established.</p></blockquote>

<h3><span class="smcap">Article XXII</span></h3>

<blockquote>

<p>Should heretics who are delivered to the secular arm
leave children who are minors and unmarried, the inquisitors
shall provide and ordain that they be cared for and reared by
some persons who will instruct them in our Holy Faith.
The inquisitors shall prepare a memorial of such orphans and
the circumstances of each, to the end that of the royal bounty
alms may be provided to the extent necessary, this being the
wish of the Sovereigns when the children are good Christians,
especially in the case of girls, who should receive a dower
sufficient to enable them to marry or enter a convent.</p></blockquote>

<p>Llorente tells us that although he went through
very many records of old proceedings of the Inquisition,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
in no single instance did he discover a record of any
such provision in favour of the child of a condemned
heretic.<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">91</a></p>

<p>Harsh as were the decrees of the Inquisition in all
things, in nothing were they so harsh as in the enactments
concerning the children of heretics. However
innocent themselves of the heresy for which their
parents or grandparents might have suffered, not only
must they go destitute, but further they must be
prevented from ever extricating themselves appreciably
from that condition, being inhibited&mdash;to the second
generation&mdash;from holding any office under the Crown,
or any ecclesiastical benefice, and from following any
honourable or lucrative profession. And, as if that
were not in itself sufficient, they were further condemned
to wear the outward signs of infamy, to go
dressed in serge, without weapons or ornaments, and
never ride on horseback, under pain of worse befalling
them. One of the inevitable results of this barbarous
decree was the extinction of many good Spanish
families of Jewish blood in the last decade of the
fifteenth century.</p>

<p>This the inquisitors understood to be the literal
application to practical life of the gentle and merciful
precepts of the sweet Christ in Whose name they
acted.</p>

<p>Eymeric and his commentator Pegna make clear,
between them, the inquisitorial point of view. The
author of the “Directorium” tells us that commiseration
for the children of heretics who are reduced to
mendicity must not be allowed to soften this severity,
since by all laws, human and divine, it is prescribed
that the children must suffer for the sins of the
fathers.<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">92</a></p>

<p>The scholiast expounds at length the justice of this
measure. He says that there have been authors, such
as Hostiensis, who pretend that it lacks the equity of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
the ancient laws, which admitted Catholic children to
inheritance. But he assures us that they are wrong in
holding such views, that there is no injustice in the
provision, and that it is salutary, since the fear of it is
calculated to influence parents and to turn them&mdash;out
of love for their offspring&mdash;from the great crime of
heresy.</p>

<p>To minds less dulled by bigotry it must have been
clear that by this, as, for that matter, by many other
of their decrees, all that was achieved was to put a
premium upon hypocrisy.</p>

<p>Another consideration that escaped their notice&mdash;being,
as they were, capable of perceiving one thing
only at a time&mdash;was that if this precious measure was
prescribed by all laws, human and divine, it should
have been unavoidable. Yet they themselves provided
the means of avoiding it&mdash;as we know&mdash;for the child
vile enough to lay information of his parents’ heresy.
By what laws, human or divine, did they dare to
encourage such an infamy? By no law but their own&mdash;a
law whose chief aim, it is obvious at every turn,
was to swell the number of convictions.</p>

<p>What opinion was held of children who informed
against their parents to avert the awful fate that
awaited them should their parents’ heresy be discovered
by others, is apparent in the case of the
daughter of Diego de Susan&mdash;who, very possibly, was
actuated by just such motives.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Article XXIII</span></h3>

<blockquote>

<p>Should any heretic or apostate who has been reconciled
within the term of grace be relieved by their Highnesses from
the punishment of confiscation of his property, it is to be
understood that such relief applies only to that property
which by their own sin was lost to them. It does not extend
to property which the person reconciled shall have the right
to inherit from another who shall have suffered confiscation.
This to the end that a person so pardoned shall not be in
better case than a pure Catholic heir.</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Article XXIV</span></h3>

<blockquote>

<p>As the King and Queen in their clemency have ordained
that the Christian slaves of heretics shall be freed, and even
when the heretic is reconciled and immune from confiscation,
this immunity shall not extend to his slaves; these shall be
manumitted in any case, to the greater honour and glory of
our Holy Faith.</p></blockquote>

<h3><span class="smcap">Article XXV</span></h3>

<blockquote>

<p>Inquisitors and assessors and other officers of the Inquisition,
such as fiscal advocates, constables, notaries, and ushers,
must excuse themselves from receiving gifts from any who
may have or may come to have affairs with the Inquisition,
or from others on their behalf; and the Father Prior of Holy
Cross orders them not to receive any such gifts under pain of
excommunication, of being deprived of office under the
Inquisition and compelled to make restitution and repay to
twice the value of what they may have received.</p></blockquote>

<p>Eymeric’s “Directorium” permitted the reception
of gifts by inquisitors, provided that these gifts were
not too considerable, but he enjoined inquisitors not to
show too much avidity&mdash;not, it would seem, on account
of the sin that lurks in avidity, but so as not to give
scandal to the laity.<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">93</a></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Article XXVI</span></h3>

<blockquote>

<p>Inquisitors shall endeavour to work harmoniously together;
the honour of the office they hold demands this, and inconveniences
might result from discords amongst them. Should
any inquisitor be acting in the place of the diocesan ordinary,
let him not on that account presume that he enjoys pre-eminence
over his colleagues. If any difference should arise
between inquisitors and they be unable themselves to adjust
it, let them keep the matter secret until they can lay it before
the Prior of Holy Cross, who, as their superior, will decide it
as he considers best.</p></blockquote>

<h3><span class="smcap">Article XXVII</span></h3>

<blockquote>

<p>Inquisitors shall endeavour to contrive that their officers
treat one another well and dwell in harmony and honourably.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
Should any officer commit an excess, let them punish him
charitably, and should they be unable to cause an officer to
fulfil his duty, let them advise the Prior of Holy Cross thereof,
and he will at once deprive such a one of his office and make
such an appointment as may seem best for the service of Our
Lord and their Highnesses.</p></blockquote>

<h3><span class="smcap">Article XXVIII</span></h3>

<blockquote>

<p>Should any matter arise for which provision has not been
made by this code, the inquisitors shall proceed as by law
prescribed, it being left to them to dispose as their consciences
show them to be best for the service of God and their
Highnesses.</p></blockquote>

<p>To these twenty-eight articles Torquemada was to
make further additions&mdash;in January of the following
year, in October of 1488 and in May of 1498. We
shall indicate to them, but for the moment it is sufficient
to say that&mdash;saving some of those of 1498&mdash;they are
of secondary importance, being mainly in the nature of
corollaries upon those we have dealt with, and chiefly
concerned with the internal governance of the Inquisition
rather than with its relations to the outside
world.

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI<br />

<span class="medium">THE JURISPRUDENCE OF THE HOLY OFFICE&mdash;THE MODE
OF PROCEDURE</span></h2>

<p>No complete notion of the jurisprudence of the Holy
Office can be formed without taking a glance at this
tribunal at work and observing the methods upon
which it proceeded in its dealings with those who were
arraigned before it.</p>

<p>Its scope has already been considered, and also
the offences that came within its pitiless jurisdiction
at the time of Torquemada’s appointment to the
mighty office of Grand Inquisitor and President of
the Suprema. It remains to be added that in his
endeavours to cast an ever-wider net he sought to
increase the jurisdiction of the Inquisition beyond
matters immediately concerned with the Faith and to
include certain offences whose connection with it was
only constructive.</p>

<p>Whether he succeeded to the full extent of his
aims we do not know. But we do know that he
contrived that bigamy should become the concern of
the Holy Office, contending that it was primarily an
offence against the laws of God and a defilement of
the Sacrament of Marriage. Adultery, which is no
less an offence against that sacrament, and which is
not punishable by civil law, he passed over; but he
contrived that sodomy should be brought for the first
time within inquisitorial jurisdiction and that those
convicted of it should be burnt alive.</p>

<p>Himself a man of the most rigid chastity, he must
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
have been moved to anger by the unchastity so prevalent
among the clergy. It was, however, beyond his
power to deal with it without special authority from
Rome, and he would have been bold indeed to have
sought such authority at the hands of that flagrant
paterfamilias Giovanni Battista Cibo, who occupied
the Chair of St. Peter with the title of Pope Innocent
VIII.</p>

<p>The most scandalous form of this unchastity was
that known as “solicitation”&mdash;<i>solicitatio ad turpia</i>&mdash;or
the abuse of the confessional for the purpose of
seducing female penitents. It was a matter that greatly
vexed the Church as a body, since it placed a terrible
weapon in the hands of her enemies and detractors.
It was admittedly rampant, and it is more than probable
that it was directly responsible for the institution of
the confessional-box&mdash;enforced in the sixteenth century&mdash;which
effectively separated confessor from penitent,
and left them to communicate through a grille.</p>

<p>The matter, like all other offences of the clergy,
was entirely within the jurisdiction of the bishops,
who would vigorously have resisted any attempts on
the part of Torquemada to encroach further upon
their province. So the Church was left to combat
that evil as best she might; and, with the exception of
an odd bishop who assumed a stern attitude and dealt
with it as became his own dignity and the honour of
the priesthood, the utmost lenience appears to have
prevailed,<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">94</a> as we may judge by the penances imposed
upon convicted offenders.</p>

<p>The perils and temptations to which a priest was
exposed in the course of the intimate communications
that must pass between him and his penitents were
given full recognition and allowed full weight in the
balance against the offence itself.</p>

<p>Later on, however, this matter which Torquemada
had considered beyond his power was actually thrust
within the jurisdiction of the Inquisition by a Church
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
resolved, for the very sake of its existence, that the
evil should cease.</p>

<p>Vexatious as this crime of “solicitation” had
always been, it became most urgently and perilously
so after the Reformation, when it provided those
who denounced the confessional with an apparently
unanswerable reason for their denunciations. It was
wisely thought that the methods of the Holy Office
were best calculated to deal with it, and the matter
was relegated to the inquisitors. The defilement of
the sacrament was the link that connected solicitation
with heresy. Moreover, in some cases there might
be heresy of a more positive kind; as when, for
instance, the priest assured the penitent that her
consent was not a sin. And the woman accusing a
priest of solicitation before the Holy Office was
always questioned closely upon this particular point.</p>

<p>In the later editions of the “Cartilla,” or Manual
for the guidance of Inquisitors&mdash;all of which publications
were issued by the private press of the Inquisition&mdash;are
to be found under the heading “Causas de
Solicitacion” instructions for the examination of a
woman who denounces a priest upon these grounds.<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">95</a></p>

<p>Even so, however, it could not be in the interests
of the Church to parade these offenders, and thus
expose the sore places in her own body.</p>

<p>Limborch urges that delinquents be sent to the
galleys, or even delivered to the secular arm. But
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
for that&mdash;as Llorente points out&mdash;it would have been
necessary to include them in an Auto de F&eacute; of which
there could be no question on account of the scandal
which must ensue in view of the character of the
offence. This is very true, and none can doubt the
desirability of avoiding publicity for such a matter,
or suppose that the Church was in the least blame-worthy
for so proceeding. At the same time, however
justifiable we may account this secrecy, it is
almost impossible to justify the lenience of the
sentences that were passed. It is above all extraordinary
that the usual punishment did not even go
so far as to unfrock these offenders. The inquisitors
confined themselves to depriving the convicted priest
of the faculty of hearing confessions in future, and
imposed a penance of some years’ residence in the
seclusion of a convent.</p>

<p>It is possible, however, that this punishment was
heavier than may at first appear. For&mdash;to their credit
be it said&mdash;the regulars into whose convent the
penanced cleric was sent undertook that this penance
should be anything but easy.</p>

<p>This comes to light in the course of a case of which
Llorente cites the full particulars from the records he
unearthed.<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">96</a></p>

<p>It is the case of a Capuchin brother tried in the
eighteenth century by the Grand Inquisitor Rubin
de Cevallos; and as much in the quality and extent
of the offence as in the brazenly ingenious defence
set up by the friar, the record reads like one of the
least translatable stories from Boccaccio’s “Decameron.”
He was sentenced to go into retreat for five years
in a convent of his order; and so great a dread did
that sentence strike into the Capuchin that he besought
of the inquisitors the mercy of being allowed to serve
the sentence in one of the dungeons of the Inquisition.
Questioned as to his reasons for a request that sounded
so extraordinary, he protested that he knew too well
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
the burden his brethren were wont to impose upon
a friar penanced as was he.</p>

<p>His petition was dismissed, the Grand Inquisitor
refusing to alter the sentence; and Llorente adds that
the Capuchin died three years later in the convent to
which he was sent.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>How far the crime was rampant when the Inquisition
was entrusted with its prosecution may be gathered
from the statistics given by H. C. Lea.<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">97</a> It appears
from these that in the city of Toledo alone, during
the first thirty-five years that the matter was in the
hands of the Holy Office, fifty-two sentences were
passed upon priests found guilty of “solicitation,” and
it is not to be supposed, as Lea very shrewdly observes,
that delations were forthcoming in more than a proportion
of the cases that occurred, or that more than
a proportion of these delations could lead to conviction&mdash;since,
to avert scandal as much as possible,
no action would be taken save where the indications
of guilt were very clear.</p>

<p>This view is certainly supported by the injunction of
caution and the other instructions in the Manual under
the heading “Causas de Solicitaciones,” already cited.</p>

<p>Finally on this subject, Llorente’s statistics show
that the offenders were chiefly friars; the proportion
of secular priests convicted being only one in ten.
This does not, however, signify greater chastity on
the part of secular priests. Llorente offers the obvious
explanation&mdash;an explanation too obvious to need repeating
here.<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">98</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Another offence that came later to be added to
those within the jurisdiction of the Holy Office was
that of usury. But in Torquemada’s day neither this
nor solicitation was allowed to be the concern of the
Inquisition.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span></p>

<p>In its methods of procedure the tribunal of the
Holy Office under the zealous rule of the Prior of
Holy Cross followed closely upon the lines laid down
by Eymeric. Indeed in the “Cartilla” or “Manual”
that was issued later for the use of inquisitors&mdash;of
which several editions are in existence to-day&mdash;these
rules taken bodily from the “Directorium” were
incorporated as a supplement to the code promulgated
by Torquemada, consisting of the articles already
considered and of others to be added later.</p>

<p>These methods we will now consider.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The accused was brought before the tribunal sitting
in the audience-chamber of the Holy Office&mdash;or Holy
House (<i>Casa Santa</i>) as the premises of the Inquisition
came to be styled.</p>

<p>The court was composed of at least one of the
inquisitors delegated by Torquemada, the diocesan
ordinary, the fiscal advocate, and a notary to take
down all that might transpire. They were seated
about a table upon which stood a tall crucifix, between
two candles, and the Gospels upon which the
accused was to be sworn.</p>

<p>The oath being administered, the prisoner was
asked his name, birthplace, particulars of his family,
and the diocese in which he resided. Next he was
vaguely questioned as to whether he had heard speak
of such matters as those upon which he was accused.<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">99</a></p>

<p>Pegna warns inquisitors against being too precise
in their questions, lest they should suggest answers
to the accused.<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">100</a> Another reason for this vagueness
was that being precisely questioned the accused might
in his answers confine himself to the matter of those
questions, whilst where the inquiry was conducted
in vague, general terms, he might in his reply betray
matters or persons hitherto unsuspected.</p>

<p>Obviously with the same end in view, the scholiast
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
suggests that the accused be asked whether he knows
why he has been arrested, and whom he suspects
of having accused him; whilst as a means of instantly
testing whether he is an observer of his Catholic duties
the inquisitors are instructed to ask him who is his confessor
and when he was last at confession. The answer
of one who was secretly an apostate, or even who had
neglected to comply with his religious duties as prescribed,
must necessarily be enormously incriminating.
It would justify violent suspicion of heresy against him,
which has already been considered, together with its
consequences.</p>

<p>Pegna further enjoins inquisitors to be careful that
they do not afford the accused any means of evading
their questions, and not to be imposed upon by protestations
or tears, heretics being, he assures them, of
an extreme cunning in dissembling their errors.</p>

<p>Eymeric specifies ten different methods employed
by heretics to trick inquisitors. These are not of any
real importance, nor do they leave us in the least
convinced that any such ruses were actually employed.
They are obviously based upon an intimate acquaintance
with priestly guile rather than upon any
experience of the craftiness of actual heretics. They
may, in short, be said to be just such ruses as the
inquisitors themselves might employ if they found
the tables turned upon themselves and the heretic
sitting in the seat of justice.</p>

<p>He urges the inquisitors to meet guile with guile:
“ut clavus clavo retundatur.” He justifies recourse
to hypocrisy and even to falsehood, telling the inquisitors
that thus they will be in a position to say:
“Cum essem astutus dolo vos cepi,” and to the ten
evasive methods which he asserts are adopted by
heretics, he bids their paternities oppose ten specified
rules by which to capture and entrap them.</p>

<p>These rules and Pegna’s commentaries upon them
are worth attention for the sake of the intimate glimpse
they afford us of the medi&aelig;val ecclesiastical mind.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span></p>

<p>The accused is to be compelled by repeated examinations
to return clear and precise answers to the
questions asked.</p>

<p>If the accused heretic is resolved not to confess
his fault, the inquisitor should address him with great
sweetness (<i>blande et mansuete</i>), giving him to understand
that all is already known to the court, speaking
as follows:</p>

<p>“Look now, I pity you who are so deluded in
your credulity, and whose soul is being lost; you are
at fault, but the greater fault lies with him who has
instructed you in these things. Do not, then, take
the sin of others upon yourself, and do not make
yourself out a master in matters in which you have
been no more than a pupil. Confess the truth to me,
because, as you see, I already know the whole affair.
And so that you may not lose your reputation, and
that I may shortly liberate and pardon you and you
may go your ways home, tell me who has led you&mdash;you
who knew no evil&mdash;into this error.”</p>

<p>By similar kind words (<i>bona verba</i>), always imperturbable
(<i>sine turbatione</i>), let the inquisitor proceed,
assuming the main fact to be true and confining his
questions to the circumstances.</p>

<p>Pegna adds another formula, which he says was
employed by Fr. Ivonet. Thus:</p>

<p>“Do not fear to confess all. You will have thought
they were good men who taught you so-and-so; you
lent ear to them freely in that belief, etc.... You
have behaved with credulous simplicity towards people
whom you believed good and of whom you knew no
evil. It might very well happen to much wiser men
than you to be so mistaken.”<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">101</a></p>

<p>Thus was the wretch coaxed to self-betrayal,
caressed and stroked by the velvet glove that muffled
and dissembled the iron hand within.</p>

<p>In the case of a heretic against whom the
witnesses have not supplied matter for complete
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
conviction, let him be brought before the inquisitor
and let the inquisitor question him at random.
When the accused shall have denied something
(<i>quando negat hoc vel illud</i>) that has been put to
him, let the inquisitor take up the minutes of the
preceding examinations, turn the leaves and say:</p>

<p>“It is clear that you conceal the truth; cease to
employ dissimulation.”</p>

<p>Thus the accused may suppose that he is convicted,
and that the minutes supply proof against him.</p>

<p>Or let the inquisitor hold a document in his hand,
and when the accused denies, let him feign astonishment
and exclaim:</p>

<p>“How can you deny such a thing? Is it not clear
to me?” He will then peruse his document anew,
making changes, and then reading once more, let him
say, “I was right! Speak, then, since you perceive
that I know.”</p>

<p>The inquisitor must be careful not to enter into
any details that might betray his ignorance to the
accused. Let him keep to generalities.</p>

<p>If the accused persists in his denial, the inquisitor
may tell him that he is about to set out upon a journey
and that he doesn’t know when he will be returning.
Thus:</p>

<p>“Look now, I pity you, and I wanted you to tell
me the truth, for I am anxious to expedite the affair
and yourself. But since you are obstinate in refusing
to confess, I must leave you in prison and in irons
until I return; and I am sorry, because I do not know
when I shall return.”</p>

<p class="caption">TOLEDO.<br />
From Colmenar’s “D&eacute;lices d’Espagne.”</p>
</div>

<p>If the accused persists in denial, let the inquisitors
multiply examinations and questions; then either the
accused will confess, or (becoming confused) will contradict
himself. If he contradicts himself that will
suffice to put him to torture, that thus the truth may
be extracted from his mouth. But frequent interrogations
should not be employed save with one of extreme
stubbornness, because to frequent questions upon the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
same matter it is easy to obtain variable answers; there
is hardly anybody who would not be surprised into
a contradiction.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Here we have a glimpse of the extraordinary
flexibility of the inquisitorial conscience. The letter
of the law must ever be observed in all proceedings;
but its spirit must by all means be circumvented
where it is expedient to do so. Certain conditions,
presently to be examined, must be present before an
accused could be put to torture. One of these was
that under examination he should contradict himself.
This rule they scrupulously observed; but they had
no qualms on the score of bringing about the requisite
condition by a trick&mdash;of compelling the accused to
contradict himself by repeated questions upon the
same subject. And Eymeric himself admits that
hardly anybody could avoid varying in his answers
under such a test.</p>

<p>It may be uncharitable to suppose that the last
paragraph of this rule is intended as a hint rather
than as the warning it pretends to be. But it is a
suspicion which the further consideration of the inquisitorial
conscience must inspire in every thoughtful
mind. It is so much of a piece with the inquisitors’
extraordinary attitude towards the letter of the law to
proceed in that way.</p>

<p>If the accused still persists in denial, the inquisitor
should now soften his conduct; let him
contrive that the prisoner has better food, and that
worthy people visit him and win his confidence; these
shall then advise him to confess, promise that the
inquisitor will pardon him (<i>faciet sibi gratiam</i>), and
that they themselves will act as mediators.</p>

<p>The inquisitor himself may in the end go so far as
to join them, and promise to accord grace (<i>i.e.</i> pardon)
to the accused, and grant him this grace in effect,
since all is grace that is done in the conversion of
heretics; penances being themselves graces and remedies.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
When the accused, having confessed his
crime, demands the promised “grace,” let him be
answered in general terms that he shall receive even
more than he could ask, so that the whole truth may
be discovered and the heretic converted<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">102</a>&mdash;“and his
soul saved, at least,” adds Pegna.<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">103</a></p>

<p>Thoroughly to appreciate the deliberate duplicity
here practised, it is necessary to take into account the
double or even treble meaning of the term grace&mdash;“gratia”&mdash;employed
by Eymeric, and having in
Spanish (<i>i.e.</i> its equivalent “gracia”) precisely the
same meanings as in Latin.</p>

<p>Although not so popularly used in these various
meanings, the English term “grace” can also signify
(<i>a</i>) the prerogative of mercy exercised as a complete
pardon, (<i>b</i>) the same prerogative exercised to relieve
part of the penalty incurred, or (<i>c</i>) a state of acceptance
with God.</p>

<p>The accused was deliberately led to suppose that
“gratia” was employed in the sense of a complete
pardon. It remained with the inquisitor to quiet his
conscience for this <i>suggestio falsi</i> by preferring the
letter to the spirit of his promise; he would enlighten
the accused that by “grace” no more was meant than
a remission of part of the penalty incurred (an insignificant
remission usually), or even that all that
he had in mind was the grace of divine favour into
which his soul would enter&mdash;so that this might be
saved at least, as Pegna explains.</p>

<p>Pegna has a good deal more to say on the same
subject, and all of it is extremely interesting.</p>

<p>He propounds the questions: “May an inquisitor
employ this ruse to discover the truth? If he enters
into such a promise is he not obliged to keep it?” By
this latter question he means, of course, the promise
to pardon which the prisoner was given to understand
was made him.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span></p>

<p>He proceeds to tell us that Dr. Cuchalon decided
the first of these questions by approving the use of
dissimulation, justifying it by the instance of Solomon’s
judgment between the mothers.</p>

<p>It really seems as if there is nothing that theologians
cannot justify by inversion, subversion, or
perversion of some precedent (more or less apocryphal
in itself) to suit their ends.</p>

<p>The scholiast himself agrees with the reverend
doctor, and considers that although jurisconsults may
disapprove of such methods in civil courts, it is quite
fit and proper to use them in the courts of the Holy
Office; explaining that the inquisitor has ampler
powers than the civil judge [which seems to be an
extraordinary reason for justifying his abuse of them].</p>

<p>Thus, Pegna pursues, in this edifying treatise upon
the uses of hypocrisy, provided that the inquisitor does
not promise the offender absolute impunity, he may
always promise him “grace” (which by the offender
is taken to signify “absolute impunity”) and keep his
promise by diminishing somewhat the <i>canonical</i> pains
that depend upon himself.</p>

<p>In actual practice this would mean that a heretic
who has incurred the stake may be promised pardon
if he will confess to the sins of which it is necessary
to convict him before he can be burnt. And when,
having confessed and delivered himself into the hands
of the inquisitor, he claims his pardon, he is to be
satisfied with the answer that the pardon meant was
pardon for his sins&mdash;absolution, that his soul may be
saved when they burn his body.</p>

<p>On the score of the second question propounded
by the scholiast&mdash;“If the inquisitor enters into such a
promise is he not obliged to keep it?”&mdash;he answers it
by telling us that many theologians do not consider
there is any such obligation on the part of the
inquisitor. This attitude they explain by urging that
such a fraud is salutary and for the public good; and,
further, that if it is licit to extract the truth by torture,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
it is surely much more so to accomplish it by dissimulation&mdash;<i>verbis
fictis</i>.</p>

<p>This is the general but by no means the universal
opinion, we gather. There are some writers who are
opposed to it. And now the scholiast becomes more
extraordinary still. Hear him:</p>

<p>“These two divergent opinions may be reconciled
by considering that whatever promises the inquisitors
make, they are not to be understood to apply to
anything beyond the penalties whose rigour the
Inquisition has the right to lessen&mdash;namely, canonical
penances, and not those by law prescribed.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>He writes this knowing that these promises are
understood by the prisoner to mean something very
different&mdash;that the prisoner is desired so to understand
them, made so to understand them.</p>

<p>The honesty of Pegna’s reasoning is not to be
suspected. He is not an apologist of the Holy Office
writing for the world in general, and employing bad
arguments perforce because he must make the best of
the only ones available, even though he should lapse
into suspicion of bad faith. He is writing, as a preceptor,
for the private eye of the inquisitor. Therefore
we can only conclude that these learned casuists
who plunge into such profundities of thought and
pursue such labyrinthine courses of reasoning had
utterly failed to grasp the elementary moral fact that
falsehood does not lie in the word uttered, but in the
idea conveyed.</p>

<p>“However little,” he continues, in the course of
polishing this gem of casuistry, “may be the remission
granted by the inquisitor, it will always be sufficient to
fulfil his promise.”</p>

<p>You see what a stickler he is for the letter of the
law. You shall see a good deal more of the same sort
of thing before we have gone much further.</p>

<p>But here the scholiast begins to labour. His
conscience is stirring; possibly a ray of doubt penetrates
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
his gloomy confidence that right is wrong and
wrong is right. And so, we fancy, to quiet these
uneasy stirrings comes the last paragraph on this
subject:</p>

<p>“However, for greater safety of conscience,
inquisitors should make no promises save in very
general terms, and never promise more than they can
fulfil.”<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">104</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There is one more of Eymeric’s ruses for combating
the guile of stubborn heretics:</p>

<p>Let the inquisitor obtain an accomplice of the
accused, or else a person esteemed by the latter and
in the inquisitor’s confidence, and engage him to talk
often to the accused and extract his secret from him.
If necessary, let this person pretend to be of the same
heretical sect, to have abjured through fear, and to
have declared all to the inquisitor.</p>

<p>Then one evening, when the accused shall have
gained confidence in this visitor, let the latter
remain until he can say that it is too late to return
home and that he will spend the night in the prison.
Let persons be suitably placed to hear the conversation
of the accused and if possible a notary to take down
in writing the confessions of the heretic, who should
now be drawn by the spy into relating all that he has
done.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Upon this subject Pegna moralizes<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">105</a> for the benefit
of the spy, pointing out how the latter may go about
his very turpid task without involving himself in
falsehood or besmirching in the least the delicate,
sensitive soul that we naturally suppose must animate
him.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“Be it noted that the spy, simulating friendship
and seeking to draw from the accused a confession of
his crime, may very well pretend to be of the sect of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
the accused, but” [mark the warning] “he must not
say so, because in saying so he would at least commit
a venial sin, and we know that such must not be
committed upon any grounds whatever.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Thus the scholiast. He makes it perfectly clear
that a man may simulate friendship for another for
the purpose of betraying that other to his death; that
to make that betrayal more certain he may even
pretend to hold the same religious convictions; all
this may he do and yet commit no sin&mdash;not even a
venial sin&mdash;so long as he does not actually clothe his
pretence in words. What a store the casuist sets by
words!</p>

<p>It is just such an argument as Caiaphas might
have employed with Judas Iscariot one evening in
Jerusalem.</p>

<p>It is a cherished thesis with apologists of the
Holy Office that in its judicial proceedings it did
neither more nor less than what was being done in
its day in the civil courts; that if its methods were
barbarous&mdash;if they shock us now&mdash;we are to remember
that they were the perfectly ordinary judicial methods
of their time.</p>

<p>But there was no secular court in Europe in the
fifteenth century&mdash;steeped as that century was in
dissimulation and bad faith&mdash;that would not have
scorned to have made such dishonourable and dishonouring
methods as these an acknowledged,
regular and integral part of its procedure.</p>

<p>Pegna himself reveals the fact, when he finds it
necessary further to justify these practices precisely
because they were not in use in the civil courts:</p>

<p>“Perchance the authority of Aristoteles&mdash;who out
of the bosom of Paganism condemned all manner of
dissimulation&mdash;may be opposed to us, as well as that
of the jurisconsults who disapprove of artifices of
which judges may make use to extract the truth.
But there are two forms of artifice: one addressed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
to an evil end, which must not be permitted; the
other aiming at discovering truth, which none could
blame.”<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">106</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When confession has been obtained it would be
idle, Eymeric points out, to grant the delinquent a
defence. “For although in civil courts the confession
of a crime does not suffice without proof, it suffices
here.” The reason advanced for this is as specious
as any in the “Directorium”: “Heresy being a sin
of the soul, confession may be the only evidence
possible.”</p>

<p>Where an advocate was granted to conduct the
defence of an accused, we have seen in Art. XVI
of Torquemada’s “Instructions” that he was under the
obligation to relinquish such defence the moment he
realized the guilt of his client, since by canon law an
advocate was forbidden to plead for a heretic in any
court, civil or ecclesiastical, or in any cause whatsoever&mdash;whether
connected with heresy or any other
matter.</p>

<p>On the subject of witnesses, it should be added to
what already has been said in the previous chapter
that the Inquisition, whilst admitting the testimony
of any man, even though he should be excommunicate
or a heretic, so long as such testimony was adverse to
the accused, refused to admit witnesses for the defence
who were themselves tainted with heresy.</p>

<p>Since to bear witness in defence of a person
charged with heresy might result in the witness
himself becoming suspect, it will be understood that
witnesses for the defence were not easily procured by
the accused.

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII<br />

<span class="medium">THE JURISPRUDENCE OF THE HOLY OFFICE&mdash;THE
AUDIENCE OF TORMENT</span></h2>

<p>Eymeric’s cold-blooded directions for leading an
accused who refused to confess into contradictions
that should justify his being put to torture have
already been considered.</p>

<p>The inquisitors could not proceed to employ the
question&mdash;as the torture was euphemistically called&mdash;save
under certain circumstances prescribed by law;
and the strict letter of the law, as you have seen, and
as you shall see further, was a thing inviolable to
these very subtle judges.</p>

<p>These circumstances, as expounded by Eymeric in
his “Directorium,”<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">107</a> are (<i>a</i>) the inconsistence of the
accused’s replies upon matters of detail whilst denying
the main fact; (<i>b</i>) the existence of semi-plenal proof
of his offence.</p>

<p>This semi-plenal proof is considered forthcoming&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(<i>a</i>) When an accused is “reputed” to be a
heretic and there is but one witness against him
who can depone to having seen or heard him do
or say that which is against the Faith. (Two
witnesses were by law required to establish his
guilt.)</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) When in the absence of witnesses there
are grounds for vehement or violent suspicion.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) When there is no evil “reputation”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
attaching to the accused, but one witness against
him and <i>grounds</i> for vehement or violent suspicion&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>
not actual suspicion but indications
of it; a suspicion of suspicion, as it were. The
distinction is most elusively fine.</p></blockquote>

<p>The scholiast Pegna adds in his commentaries that
this combination of “reputation” (or grounds for
suspicion) and one witness is not necessary to justify
submitting the accused to the question&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(<i>a</i>) When to evil reputation are added evil
morals, which lead easily to heresy&mdash;thus those
who are incontinent and very greatly addicted to
women persuade themselves that this incontinence
is not in itself a sin. (Such an opinion if proclaimed
would amount to heresy, therefore one
who acts as if he held it lays himself open to
suspicion of heresy.)</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) When the accused who has incurred evil
reputation shall have fled. (The circumstance of
his flight is accepted as evidence of evil conscience.)<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">108</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Eymeric further enjoins that the question shall
be employed only when all other means of obtaining
the truth shall have failed, and he recommends the
use of exhortation, gentleness, and ruse to draw the
truth from the prisoner.<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">109</a></p>

<p>He observes that, after all, not even the torture
can be depended upon always to extract the truth.
There are weak men who under the first torments
confess even what they have not done; and there are
others so stubborn and vigorous that they can suffer
the greatest pains; there are those who having already
undergone torture are able to endure it with greater
fortitude, knowing how to adapt themselves to it; and
there are others still who, by having recourse to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
sorcery, remain almost insensible to the pain and
would die before divulging anything.</p>

<p>These last, he warns inquisitors, use passages
from the Gospel curiously inscribed upon virgin
parchment, intermingling in these the names of angels
that are unknown, designs of circles, and magic
characters. These charms they bear about their
bodies.</p>

<p>“I don’t yet know,” he confesses, “what remedies
are available against these sorceries; but it will be
well to strip and closely to examine the patient before
putting him to the question.”</p>

<p>He recommends that when the accused has been
sentenced to torture, and whilst the executioners are
making ready to perform it, the inquisitor should continually
endeavour to induce the accused to confess.
The torturers should strip him with precipitation, but
with a sorrowful air and almost as if troubled for him
(<i>quasi turbati</i>). When stripped, he should be taken
aside and once more exhorted to confess. His life
may be promised him, provided that the crime of
which he is accused is not such as to make it forfeit.</p>

<p>If all proves vain the inquisitor shall proceed to
the question, beginning by interrogating him upon the
more trivial matters of which he is accused, as he
would naturally acknowledge these more readily (and
when acknowledged they can be made the stepping-stones
to more), the notary being at hand to write
down all that is asked and answered.</p>

<p>If he persists in his denials he is to be shown
further implements of torture, and assured that he will
have to undergo them all unless he speaks the truth.</p>

<p>If he still denies, the question may be <i>continued</i>
on the second or third day, but not <i>repeated</i>.</p>

<p>Here again we have them observing the letter and
flagrantly violating the spirit of the law. Torture
must not be repeated because it is by law forbidden
to put an accused to the question more than once,
unless in the meantime fresh evidence has been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
forthcoming; but it is not forbidden to continue it&mdash;not
forbidden because those who formulated that law
never dreamt of such a quibble being raised.</p>

<p>It is almost incredible that men should juggle with
words in this way. But here is the passage itself:</p>

<p>“Ad continuandum non ad iterandum, quia iterari
non debent, nisi novis supervenientibus indiciis, sed
continuari non prohibentur.”</p>

<p>Lest they should be in danger of having to repeat
the torture, they took care to suspend it as soon as the
patient was at the limit of his endurance, and merely
resumed or continued it two or three days later, to
suspend again and continue again as often as they
might deem necessary.</p>

<p>That it can have made no difference to the wretched
patient whether they described the procedure by one
verb or the other does not appear to have weighed
with them. There was a difference&mdash;an important
verbal difference.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Upon this point the apologist Garcia Rodrigo, in
his “Historia Verdadera de la Inquisicion,” very
daringly draws attention to the meekness of the courts
of the Inquisition as compared with the civil tribunals.
He contrasts the methods of the two, and to make out
a case in favour of the former, to prove to us that
those who preached a gospel of mercy knew also how
to practise mercy, he tells us, rather disingenuously,
that whilst in civil courts a prisoner might be ordered
three times to the torture, in the courts of the Inquisition
this could not be imposed upon him more than
once&mdash;<i>its rules forbidding repetition</i>.</p>

<p>He does not consider it worth while to add that the
“Directorium” in which he found that rule points out,
as we have seen, how it may be circumvented</p>

<p>It is much easier to set up a case for the other side,
to show that the greater mercy in the matter of torture
was practised by the secular courts. In these, for
instance, a nobleman was immune from torture. Not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
so in the courts of the Inquisition, which proceeded,
no doubt, upon the grounds that all are equals in the
sight of God. No exception was made there in favour
of any man. And in Aragon, where the torture
was never applied in civil trials, it was none the less
resorted to by the inquisitors.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When the accused shall have endured torture without
confessing, the inquisitors may order his release
by sentence, stating that after careful examination they
are unable to find anything against him on the score
of the crime of which he is accused&mdash;which, of course,
is no acquittal, since he may at any time be re-arrested
and put upon his trial once more.</p>

<p>In his commentaries Pegna tells us<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">110</a> that there are
five degrees of torture. He does not mention them
in detail, saying that they are sufficiently well known
to all. These five degrees are given in Limborch.<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">111</a></p>

<p>The first four are not so much torture as terror&mdash;or
mental torture; it is only in the fifth degree that this
becomes physical. The conception is of an almost
fiendish subtlety; and yet its aim, we must believe,
was merciful, since they accounted it more merciful to
torture and terrify the mind than to bruise the flesh.</p>

<p>Eymeric’s directions are the basis of this, although
Eymeric himself does not break up the procedure into
degrees. These are:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang">(1) The threat of torture.</p>

<p class="hang">(2) Being conducted to the torture-chamber and
shown the implements and their functions.</p>

<p class="hang">(3) Stripping and preparing for the ordeal.</p>

<p class="hang">(4) Laying and binding upon the engine.</p>

<p class="hang">(5) The actual torture.</p></blockquote>

<p>The actual torture was of various kinds, any of
which the inquisitor might employ as he considered
most suitable and effective, but Pegna admonishes him
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
not to resort to unusual ones. Marsilius, the scholiast
informs us, mentions fourteen different varieties, and
adds that he had imagined others, such as that of
depriving a prisoner of sleep. In this he appears to
have received the approval of other authors, but he
does not receive Pegna’s. Even the scholiast is
shocked at an ecclesiastic’s fertility of invention in this
branch, and confesses that such researches are better
suited to executioners than theologians.</p>

<p>It must be admitted that the records show none of
that fiendish invention which is so widely believed to
have been exercised. The cruel subtleties of the
inquisitors were spiritual rather than physical, and we
have just seen Pegna’s censure of an inquisitor who
gave his attention to the devising of novel and ingenious
torments.</p>

<p>It is very clear, from the records we have, that the
Holy Office must have been content to depend upon
the engines already in existence, or, rather, upon a
limited number of the most efficacious. There were
exceptions, of course. The torture of fire&mdash;which
consisted in toasting the feet of the patient after anointing
them with fat&mdash;appears upon rare occasions to
have been employed; and a barbarous piece of supererogative
cruelty was practised at a great Auto de F&eacute;
held at Valladolid in 1636: ten Jews convicted of
having whipped a crucifix were made to stand with
one hand nailed to an arm of a St. Andrew’s cross
whilst sentence of death was being read to them.</p>

<p>As a rule, however, both in torturing and in punishing
the inquisitors avoided novelties. For the question
they usually resorted to one of three methods: the
rack; the <i>garrucha</i>, which is the torture of the hoist,
the <i>tratta di corda</i> of the Italians; and the <i>escalera</i>,
or <i>potro</i>, or ladder, or water torture.</p>

<p>The inquisitors attended in person&mdash;as prescribed
by Torquemada&mdash;to question the patient, accompanied
by their notary, who wrote down in fullest detail an
account of the proceedings.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span></p>

<p>The hoist was the simplest of all engines; it consisted
of no more than a rope running through a pulley
attached to the ceiling of the torture-chamber.</p>

<p>The patient’s wrists were pinioned behind him, and
one end of the rope was attached to them. Slowly
then the executioners drew upon the other end,
gradually raising the patient’s arms behind him as far
as they would go, backwards and upwards, and continuing
until they brought him to tip-toe and then slowly
off the ground altogether, so that the whole weight of
his body was thrown upon his straining arms.</p>

<p>At this point he was again questioned and desired
to confess the truth.</p>

<p>If he refused to speak, or if he spoke to no such
purpose as his questioners desired, he was hoisted
towards the ceiling, then allowed to drop a few feet,
his fall being suddenly arrested by a jerk that almost
threw his arms out of their sockets. Again was the
question put, and if he continued stubborn he was
given a further drop, and so on until he had come to
the ground once more, or until he had confessed. If
he reached the ground without confessing, weights
were now attached to his feet, thus increasing the
severity of the torture, which was resumed. And so it
continued. The weights were increased, the drops
were lengthened&mdash;or else he might be left hanging&mdash;until
confession was extracted, or until with dislocated
shoulders the patient had reached the limit of his
endurance.<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">112</a></p>

<p>In the latter case the torture might be suspended,
as we have seen, to be continued two or three days
later, when the prisoner should sufficiently have
recovered.</p>

<p>The notary made a scrupulous record of the
<i>audiencia</i>&mdash;the weights attached, the number of hoists
endured, the questions asked and the answers delivered.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span></p>

<p>The potro, or water-torture, was more complex,
far more cruel, and appears to have been greatly
favoured by the Holy Office.</p>

<p>The patient was placed upon a short narrow
engine, in the shape of a ladder, and this was slanted
a little so that his head was below the level of his feet,
for reasons that will soon be apparent. His head was
now secured by a metal or leather band which held it
rigidly in position, whilst his arms and legs were lashed
to the sides of the ladder so tightly that any movement
on his part must cause the whipcord to cut into his
flesh.</p>

<p>In addition to these bindings garrotes were applied
to his thighs and legs and arms. This was a length
of cord tied firmly about a limb&mdash;upon occasion round
the whole torso over the arms; a stick was thrust
between the cord and the flesh, and by twisting this
stick a tourniquet was formed; first strangury, then
the most agonizing pain was thus occasioned, whilst if
the twisting was carried far enough the cords would
sink through nerve and sinew until they reached the
bone.</p>

<p>The mouth of the patient was now distended and
held so by a prong of iron&mdash;called a <i>bostezo</i>. His
nostrils were plugged, and a long strip of linen was
placed across his jaws, and carried deep into his throat
by the weight of water poured into his gaping mouth.
Down this <i>toca</i>&mdash;as the strip was called&mdash;water continued
to be slowly poured. As this water filtered
through the cloth, the patient was subjected to all the
torments of suffocation, the more cruel because he was
driven by his instincts to make futile efforts to ease
his condition. He would constantly exert himself to
swallow the water, hoping thus to clear the way for a
little air to pass into his bursting lungs. A little would
and did pass in&mdash;just enough to keep him alive and
conscious, but not enough to mitigate the horrible
sufferings of asphyxiation, for the cloth was always
wet and constantly charged with water.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span></p>

<p>From time to time the <i>toca</i> was brought up, and
the gasping wretch would be invited to confess.
Further to combat stubbornness on his part, and also,
it would seem, to revive him when he was failing, the
executioners would give an agonizing turn or two to
the garrotes upon his&mdash;or her&mdash;limbs; for the Holy
Office did not discriminate between the sexes in these
matters.</p>

<p>To prevent the vomiting which any form of
torture might produce, and the <i>potro</i> in particular, the
inquisitors, with their never-failing attention to detail,
provided that no patient should be given food for
eight hours before the question was applied. The
notary present at this <i>audiencia de tormento</i> was
required to set down, in addition to questions asked
and answers returned, the fullest details of the torture
applied, and particularly how many jars of water were
administered, these being the measure of the severity
of the ordeal.<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">113</a></p>

<p>The rack is too well-known to need describing
here, having in its time been used in all European
countries. Cruel as it was, it was perhaps one of
the least cruel engines of torture that have been
employed.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was required by law that any confession extracted
under torture should afterwards be ratified by
the prisoner. This was one of the prescriptions
of Alfonso XI in the Partidas code. It recognizes
that a man might be driven by pain to say that
which is not true, and therefore it forbids the courts
to accept as evidence what might be declared under
torture.</p>

<p>Therefore on one of the three days after the
question had been applied&mdash;as soon, presumably, as
the prisoner was sufficiently recovered to attend&mdash;the
prisoner was brought once more into the audience-chamber.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span></p>

<p>His confession, reduced to writing by the notary,
was placed before him, and he was invited to sign
it&mdash;the act being necessary to convert that confession
into admissible evidence. If he signed, the proceedings
now ran swiftly and uninterruptedly to their
end. If he refused to sign, repudiating the statements
made, the inquisitors proceeded upon the lines laid
down by Torquemada in Article XV of his “Instructions”
to meet the case.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Pegna warns inquisitors against delinquents who
feign madness to avoid the torture. They should not,
he says, delay on that account, for the torture may be
the best means of ascertaining whether the madness
is real or simulated.<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">114</a></p>

<p>Finally let it be added upon this gruesome subject
that it was not only the accused who was liable to be
put to the question. A witness suspected of falsehood,
or one who had lapsed into contradictions in the
course of his evidence, might be put to torture <i>in
caput alienum</i>.<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">115</a>

<p>The comparatively light sentences imposed upon those
who came forward to abjure heresies which they were
suspected of harbouring, and upon those who submitted
to canonical purgation to cleanse them of “evil
reputation,” have already been considered.</p>

<p>It remains to be seen how the Holy Office dealt
with <i>negativos</i>&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> those who persisted in refusal
to confess a first offence of heresy or apostasy after
their guilt had been established to the satisfaction of
the court&mdash;and with <i>relapsos</i>&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> those who were
convicted of having relapsed into error after once
having been penanced and pardoned.</p>

<p>Offenders in either of these two classes were to
be abandoned to the secular arm&mdash;the ecclesiastical
euphemism for death by fire. The same fate also
awaited impenitent heretics and contumacious heretics.</p>

<p>He who after having been convicted by sufficient
witnesses persisted in denying his guilt should, says
Eymeric, be abandoned to the secular arm upon the
ground that he who denies a crime which has been
proved against him is obviously impenitent.<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">116</a></p>

<p>The impenitence is by no means obvious. It is
possible, after all, that the accused might deny because
he was innocent and a good Catholic. And whilst,
as we shall see, this possibility is not altogether
ignored, yet it is given very secondary consideration.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
It was the inquisitor’s business to assume the guilt of
any one brought before him.</p>

<p>It is true, however, that Eymeric urges the inquisitors
to proceed very carefully in the examination of
the witnesses against such a man; he recommends
them to give the accused time in which to resolve
himself to confess, and to employ every possible means
to obtain such confession.</p>

<p>He counsels them to confine the prisoner in an
uncomfortable dungeon, fettered hand and foot; there
to visit him frequently and exhort him to confess.
Should he ultimately do so, he is to be treated as a
penitent heretic<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">117</a>&mdash;in other words he is to escape the
fire but suffer perpetual imprisonment.</p>

<p>The term perpetual imprisonment, or perpetual
immuration, is not to be accepted too literally. It
lay at the discretion of the inquisitors to modify and
commute part of such sentences, and this discretion
they exercised so far as the imprisonment was concerned.
But the confiscation of the prisoner’s property
and the infamy attaching to himself, his children, and
his grandchildren&mdash;by far the heavier part of the
punishment&mdash;could not in any way be commuted.</p>

<p>However tardily confession might come from the
<i>negativo</i>, the inquisitors must accept and recognize it.
Even if he were already bound to the stake, and, at
last, being taken with the fear of death, he turned to
the friar who never left him until the faggots were
blazing, admitted his guilt and offered to abjure his
heresy, his life would be spared. And this for all
that they recognized that a confession in such extremes
was wrung from him by “the fear of death rather than
any love of truth.”</p>

<p>It must naturally occur to any one that, conducted
in secret as were the examinations of the witnesses,
and no opportunity being afforded the accused of
demolishing the evidence offered against him, since he
was rarely informed of its extent, many a good Catholic,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
or, at least, many a man innocent of all heretical
practices, must have gone to his death as a <i>negativo</i>.
For the methods of the Holy Office opened the door
extraordinarily wide to malevolence; and human nature
being such as it is&mdash;and such as it was in the fifteenth
century&mdash;it is not to be supposed that malevolence
never seized the chance, that it never slunk in through
that gaping door to vent itself in such close and
sheltered secrecy&mdash;to strike in the back, in the dark,
with almost perfect immunity to itself, at the man
who was hated, or envied, or whom it was desired to
supplant.</p>

<p>It was not sufficient for the prisoner to protest
his innocence. He must prove it categorically. An
innocent man might be unable to furnish categorical
proof; witnesses for the defence were extremely
difficult to obtain by one who was charged with heresy;
it was a dangerous thing to testify in favour of such a
man; should his conviction none the less follow, the
witness for the defence might find himself prosecuted
as a befriender, or <i>fautor</i>, of heretics. Yet, even when
testimony for the defence was obtained, the judges
leaned upon principle to the side of the accusers; and
since they considered it their mission to convict rather
than to judge, they would always assume that the
accusers were better informed than the defenders.</p>

<p>Therefore this danger of death to the innocent
existed. The inquisitors themselves did not lose sight
of it, for they lost sight of nothing. But how did
they provide for it? Pegna has a great deal to say
upon the subject. He tells us that some authorities
pretend that when a <i>negativus</i> protests that he staunchly
believes all that is taught by the Roman Catholic
Church such a man should not be abandoned to the
secular arm.</p>

<p>But this is an argument mentioned by the scholiast
merely that he may demolish it. It is indefensible, he
says with confidence; and, as indefensible, it is almost
universally rejected.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span></p>

<p>Torquemada most certainly did not favour it.
He lays it down clearly in Art. XXIV of his first
“Instrucciones” that a <i>negativo</i> must be deemed
an impenitent heretic, however much he may protest
his Catholicism. The accused will not satisfy
the Church, which demands confession of his fault
solely that she may pardon it; and she cannot pardon
it until it is confessed. That is the inquisitorial view
of the matter.</p>

<p>It is evident that the danger of occasionally burning
an innocent man did not perturb the inquisitorial mind.
In fact, Pegna reveals to the full the equanimity with
which it could contemplate such an accident.</p>

<p>“After all,” says he, “should an innocent person
be unjustly condemned, he should not complain of the
sentence of the Church, which was founded upon
sufficient proof, and which cannot judge of what is
hidden. If false witnesses condemned him, he should
receive the sentence with resignation, and rejoice in
dying for the truth.”<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">118</a></p>

<p>He is also, we are to suppose, to rejoice with the
same lightheartedness at the prospect of his children’s
destitution and infamy.</p>

<p>Anything, it seems, is possible to argument, and
the craziest argument may be convincing to him who
employs it. Pegna makes this abundantly clear.</p>

<p>An innocent man might be tempted to save his
life by a falsehood, by making the desired confession;
and many a man may so have escaped burning. This
also the scholiast duly weighs. He propounds the
question whether a man convicted by false witnesses
is justified in saving his life by a confession of crimes
which he has not committed.<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">119</a></p>

<p>He contends that, reputation being an external
good, each is at liberty to sacrifice it to avoid torments
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
that are hurtful, or to save his life, which is the most
precious of all possessions.</p>

<p>In this contention the scholiast lacks his usual
speciousness. He has entirely overlooked that whether
an innocent man confesses or not, whether he is burnt
or sent to perpetual imprisonment, his reputation is
equally blasted. The inquisitors see to that. His
silence is interpreted as impenitence.</p>

<p>But it is evident that Pegna himself is not quite
satisfied with what he urges. He vacillates a little.
Strong swimmer though he is, these swirling waters
of casuistry begin to give him trouble. He seems
here to turn in an attempt to regain the shore. “Who
thus accuses himself,” he concludes, “commits a venial
sin against the love which he owes himself and a falsehood
in confessing a crime which he has not committed.
This falsehood is particularly criminal when uttered to
a judge who examines juridically, for it then becomes
a mortal sin. And even though it were no more than
venial, it would not be permitted to commit it for the
sake of avoiding death or torture.”</p>

<p>“Therefore,” he sums up, “however hard it may
seem for an innocent man condemned as a <i>negativus</i>
to die under such circumstances, his confessor must
exhort him not to accuse himself falsely, reminding
him that if he suffers death with resignation he will
obtain the martyr’s immortal crown.”</p>

<p>In short, to burn at the stake for crimes never
committed is a boon, a privilege, a glory to be enjoyed
with a profound gratitude towards the inquisitors who
vouchsafed it. One cannot help a pang of regret at
the thought that the scholiast himself should have been
denied that glory.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A person was considered <i>relapsus</i>&mdash;relapsed into
heresy&mdash;not only if, as in the case of the self-delator
who availed himself of the edict of grace, he had once
been pardoned an avowed heresy, but if he had
once abjured a heresy of which he had been suspected
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
either vehemently or violently. And it was of no
account whether the heresy of which he was now
convicted was that particular one of which formerly
he had been suspected, or an entirely fresh one.
Moreover, to convict as a relapsed heretic one who
had already abjured, it was sufficient to show that he
held intercourse with heretics.</p>

<p>Further, a person would be dealt with as <i>relapsus</i>
in the event of formal proof appearing that he had
actually committed the heresy which he had abjured
as suspect, although his conduct since abjuration
might have been entirely blameless. For it was
argued that these fresh proofs, although acquired
after abjuration, revealed the person’s real guilt, and
showed that he had been judged too leniently in
being allowed to abjure merely upon suspicion.<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">120</a></p>

<p>In fact, it was held that he had acted in bad faith
towards the inquisitors; that he had neglected to
confess his sin when he was given the opportunity;
that he had attempted to defraud the treasury of his
property, which was due to it by confiscation. Since
he had not made an open and complete confession, it
was argued that he was clearly an impenitent heretic,
for whom there could be no mercy&mdash;or only a very
slight one, as we shall see.</p>

<p>Canonical purgation entailed the same sequel as
abjuration for one against whom proofs of heresy were
afterwards forthcoming. Thus, to quote an instance
given by Pegna: if a man should be suspected of
thinking that heretics should be tolerated, and if after
being canonically purged of the offence against the
Faith contained in that sentiment of which he was
suspected, it should be proved against him that his
acts or words had actually expressed that sentiment,
he must be considered a relapsed heretic.</p>

<p>Torquemada further decreed that any who after
reconciliation should fail to fulfil the penance imposed
upon him, or any part of it, must be deemed relapsed.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
The argument, obviously, was that a neglect
of this penance showed a want of proper contrition,
which could only be explained in one way.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A relapsed heretic, once his guilt was thoroughly
established, must be “abandoned to the secular arm,”
and this notwithstanding any repentance he might
manifest or any promises he might make for the future.
“<i>Sine audientia quacumque</i>,” says Eymeric.<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">121</a> “In
effect,” adds his commentator, “it is enough that
such people should once have defrauded the Church
by false confession”<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">122</a>&mdash;a statement this, diametrically
opposed to the injunction of the Founder of Christianity
on the score of forgiveness.</p>

<p>All the mercy they vouchsafed a relapsed heretic
who confessed and expressed repentance was the mercy
of being strangled at the stake before his body was burnt.</p>

<p>Eymeric instructs inquisitors to see that the prisoner
is visited and entertained on the subject of contempt
for this world, the miseries of this life and the joys of
Paradise. He should be given to understand that
there is no hope of his escaping temporal death, and
he should be induced to put the affairs of his conscience
in order. He is to be accorded the sacraments of
Penitence and the Eucharist if he solicits them with
humility. Further, the inquisitor is advised not to
visit him personally, lest the sight of him should excite
the sin of anger in the doomed man, and so turn him
from the sentiments of patience and penance which
are to be inspired in him.</p>

<p>It would seem at least that the inquisitors had no
delusions as to the sentiments which the sight of them
inspired in their victims, just as it seems that they
were able to endure these with Christian resignation&mdash;perhaps
even with that sense of martyrdom of him
who accounts himself misunderstood or misjudged.</p>

<p>After some days thus employed in preparing the
prisoner for death, the inquisitor should advise the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
secular justices of the day and hour and place when
and where he would abandon to them a heretic. At
the same time an announcement should be made to
the people inviting them to attend, as the inquisitor is
to preach a sermon of the Faith, and those who are
present will gain the usual indulgences.<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">123</a></p>

<p>It is not necessary at present to enter into particulars
of the dread ceremonial, the ghastly, almost
theatrical, solemnities that went to compose the
greatest horror that has sprung from the womb of
Christianity: the Auto de F&eacute;.</p>

<p>“An Asiatic,” says Voltaire, “arriving in Madrid
on the day of an Auto de F&eacute;, would doubt whether
here was a festival, a religious celebration, a sacrifice,
or a massacre. It is all of these. They reproach
Montezuma with sacrificing human captives to God.
What would he have said had he witnessed an Auto
de F&eacute;?”<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">124</a></p>

<p>Occasion to enter into these details will occur later.
We are more concerned at the moment with the words
of the inquisitors than with their acts, and it is necessary
on the subject of the laws that governed the Auto
de F&eacute; to touch upon quite the most extraordinary of
all the quibbles by means of which the Holy Office
avoided&mdash;in the letter&mdash;committing an irregularity.</p>

<p>Nothing in the whole of its jurisprudence savours
more rankly of hypocrisy than this matter of abandoning
a heretic to the secular arm. It is the very last
word in that science which it is the fashion to call
“Jesuitism,” but which we think might quite as aptly
and justly be termed “Dominicanism.” Yet it would
be very rash to say that these men were prompted by
conscious hypocrisy. Such is certainly not the inference
to be drawn from their jurisprudence. Stupidity&mdash;the
stupidity of the man of one idea, of the man who
is able to perceive but one thing at a time&mdash;was, rather
than hypocrisy, responsible for what they did.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span></p>

<p>They were imbued with a passion for formality,
for procedure that should be scrupulously correct,
scrupulously in accordance with the letter of the law;
and they justified their circumvention, their perversion
of its spirit, with crazy arguments that must at least
have been convincing to themselves, obfuscated as
they were by the fanaticism that bubbled through their
extraordinary intelligences.</p>

<p>We say that these arguments must have been convincing
to themselves, because we find them in books
that were never intended to be perused by any but
inquisitors and ecclesiastics. Since these books were
never meant to be placed before the world, no suspicion
can attach to them of having deliberately and hypocritically
resorted to sophistries for the purpose of
hoodwinking the lay mind.</p>

<p>It was themselves they hoodwinked&mdash;by the arguments
they themselves conceived&mdash;and although it is
undeniable that they practised a deception which must
provoke the scorn of every thoughtful man, yet it
must be remembered that this deception was the self-deception
that lies in wait for every fanatic, whatever
the subject of his fanaticism. By staring too long and
too intently at one object, that object itself becomes
blurred and indistinct.</p>

<p>“<i>Ecclesia abhorret a sanguine.</i>”</p>

<p>That was the principle that governed them. Conceive
it!</p>

<p>The tenet that a Christian must not be guilty of
shedding blood or causing the death of a fellow-creature
has been touched upon more than once in these pages.
It has been seen how in the very dawn of Christianity
the Christian’s refusal to bear arms in the service of
the State gave rise to friction with the Roman authorities,
and, being construed into insubordination, was
one of the causes of the persecutions to which Christians
were subjected in the first and second centuries.
As time went on, under stress of the necessities of this
world, the Christian was forced to abandon that fine
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
and loftily humanitarian ideal. Soon he had not only
abandoned it under pressure of expediency, but he had
forgotten it altogether; so that he donned the cross of
the crusader, and went forth sword in hand, exultantly,
to shed the blood of the infidel in the name of that
tender Founder Whose disciple had brought to Rome
the great Message of Forbearance.</p>

<p>But however much it might be accounted justifiable
and even necessary for the Christian layman to wield
the sword, the priest still continued under the prohibition
to shed blood or compass the death of any man.
And if a priest lay under such an injunction, so must
a tribunal that was controlled by priests.</p>

<p>Therefore it follows that not only was it admittedly
illicit for the inquisitor to pass a capital sentence, to
send a man to his death, but even to be in any way a
party to such an act.</p>

<p>This was the letter of the law, and, happen what
might, that letter must suffer no violence. Nor did it.
When the accused was found guilty of heresy, when
he was impenitent, or relapsed, the inquisitor was
careful that the sentence he passed contained no single
word that could render him responsible for the delinquent’s
death. Far from it. The inquisitors earnestly
implored the secular justiciaries to whom they abandoned
him not to do him any hurt whatever.</p>

<p>But consider the actual formula of the sentence as
prescribed by Eymeric. It concluded thus:</p>

<p>“The Church of God can do no more for you,
since you have already abused its goodness....
Therefore we cast you out from the Church, and
we abandon you to the secular justice, beseeching
it none the less, and earnestly, so to moderate its
sentence that it may deal with you without shedding
your blood or putting you in danger of death.”<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">125</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span></p>

<p>They were careful not so much as to say that they
<i>delivered</i> him to the secular arm; for delivery suggests
activity in a matter in which they must remain
absolutely passive. They merely <i>abandoned</i> him.
Pilate-like, they washed their hands of him. If the
secular justiciaries chose to bear him away and burn
him at the stake in spite of their “earnest intercessions”
to the contrary, that was the secular justiciaries’
affair.</p>

<p>Thus was the letter of the law most scrupulously
observed, and the inquisitor displayed in his intercession
on the heretic’s behalf the benignity proper
to his sacerdotal office. His conscience was entirely
at peace.</p>

<p>For the rest, he knew, of course, that there was
a bull of Innocent IV, known as “ad extirpanda,”
which compelled the secular justiciaries, under pain
of greater excommunication, and of being themselves
prosecuted as heretics and <i>fautores</i>, to put to death
within a term of not more than five days any convicted
heretic taken within their jurisdiction.</p>

<p>Francesco Pegna recommends inquisitors to be
careful not to omit the intercession on the prisoner’s
behalf, lest they should render themselves guilty of an
irregularity. At the same time he raises the interesting
question whether an inquisitor can reconcile this
intercession with his conscience&mdash;not, as you might
suppose, upon the score of the dissimulation it entails;
but purely on the ground that it is most strictly forbidden
to intercede on behalf of heretics; to do so,
indeed, is to incur suspicion of being a befriender of
heretics&mdash;an offence as punishable as heresy itself.</p>

<p>This question he has no difficulty in answering.
Thus:</p>

<p>“In truth it would not be permitted to employ
for a heretic an intercession that would be of any
advantage to him, or which tended to hinder the
justice which is to be executed upon his crime, but
only an intercession whose aim it is to relieve
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
the inquisitor of the irregularity he might otherwise
incur.”</p>

<p>He goes on to say that when the heretic has been
abandoned to the secular justiciaries, the latter must
pronounce their own sentence and conduct him to
the place of execution, permitting him to be accompanied
by pious men, who will pray for him and not
leave him until he shall have delivered up his soul.
And he reminds the inquisitors&mdash;though it hardly
seems necessary&mdash;that should the magistrates delay in
putting to death a heretic who has been abandoned
to them, they must be regarded as <i>fautores</i> and
themselves prosecuted.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Innocent IV, as we have seen, allowed the magistrates
a term of five days in which to do their duty
in this matter, and in Italy it was usual to take the
heretics back to prison after sentence, and bring them
forth again upon a week-day&mdash;always within the prescribed
term&mdash;to be burnt. In Spain, however, the
custom was that the magistrates having pronounced
their own sentence&mdash;as soon as the heretic was
abandoned to them&mdash;should immediately proceed to
execute it.</p>

<p>According to some authorities the sentence, by
which was meant the Auto de F&eacute; generally, should
not take place in church. Pegna agrees with these,
but not upon the score of the desecration of sanctuary,
which was their reason. He agrees because in a large
open space higher scaffolds can be erected for the
Auto, and greater multitudes can assemble to witness
this uplifting spectacle of the triumph of the Faith.
On the same grounds does he belittle those who
maintain that heretics should not be put to death on
Sundays. He considers it quite the best day of the
week, and excellent the Spanish custom that appoints
it for the Auto, “for,” he says, “it is good that large
multitudes should attend, so that fear may turn them
from evil ways; the spectacle being one that inspires
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
the attendance with terror and presents a fearful image
of the last judgment.”</p>

<p>That it is expedient to put heretics to death
no pious authority has ever ventured to dispute.
But there have been differences of opinion on the
subject of the means by which this should be done.
The scholiast is entirely on the side of the large
majority that considers fire the proper instrument,
and actually cites the Saviour’s own authority
for this: “If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth
as a branch that is withered; and men gather them,
and cast them into the fire, and they are burned”
(John xv. 6).</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>If the accused should happen to be a cleric, he
must be unfrocked and degraded by a bishop before
being arrayed in the hideous <i>sanbenito</i> and abandoned
to the secular arm, whilst those convicted of contumacy
were&mdash;if still absent at the time of the
sentence&mdash;to be burnt in effigy pending their capture,
when, without further trial, they would be burnt alive.</p>

<p>In effigy also were burnt those convicted after
death, these effigies being cast into the flames together
with the remains of the dead man, which were exhumed
for the purpose.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Reference has several times been made here to
the <i>sanbenito</i> which was imposed upon all whom the
Holy Office found guilty of heresy, whether reconciled
or abandoned, and also upon those who were suspected
in the degree <i>violenter</i>.</p>

<p>In this garment they attended the Auto de F&eacute;,
and went to execution if they were abandoned; or
they might be required to wear it for varying periods
after reconciliation, and in some instances for as long
as they lived, to advertise their infamy.</p>

<p>It was the perversion into a garb of shame and
disgrace of the penitential garment originally prescribed
by St. Dominic; for whereas once it&mdash;or,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
rather, that from which it was derived&mdash;had been
worn even by princes as an outward mark of contrition
for the sins into which they had fallen, it was
now imposed that it might subject its wearer to
opprobrium and contempt.</p>

<p>St. Dominic’s instructions were that it should
be a sackcloth habit, of the kind worn by his own
brotherhood, and that its colour might be at the
discretion of the wearer so long as it was sombre.
As it had ever been the custom of the Church to
bless the “sack” or tunic worn by members of
religious confraternities or by those upon whom it
had been imposed as a penance, such a garment was
called a <i>saco bendito</i>, which in course of time was contracted
into <i>sanbenito</i>, though also known by its proper
Spanish name of <i>zamarra</i>.</p>

<p>When the crusade against the Albigensian heretics
was at its height in Southern France, not only did the
crusaders wear the cross upon their garments, but all
faithful Catholics assumed it for their protection; for&mdash;as
on the night of the St. Bartholomew, some four
centuries later&mdash;no man’s life was safe if he did not
display that device. St. Dominic desired that the
penitent should enjoy the same protection, but so that
his penance should still be proclaimed, he was ordered
to wear two crosses, one on each breast.</p>

<p>Later, when the wars of religion had ceased, and
the general wearing of the cross was abandoned, the
Council of Toulouse decreed, in 1229, that these
penitential crosses should be yellow, whilst the Council
of Beziers, four years later, going further into the
matter, ordained that they should be two and a half
hands long (vertical) by two hands wide (horizontal),
and that they should be made of cloth of the width of
three fingers. Instead of being worn upon the breast,
as hitherto, they were now placed one on the breast
and one on the back, with a third on the hood or veil
if hood or veil were worn.</p>

<p>For abettors of heresy the following solemn
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
penance was enjoined by the Council of Tarragona in
1242:</p>

<p>“On All Saints’, on the First Sunday in Advent, on
the feasts of Christmas, the Circumcision, the Epiphany,
St. Mary of February (Purification), St. Mary
of March, and all Sundays in Lent, the penitents shall
go to the Cathedral to take part in the procession.
They shall be dressed only in their shirts, barefoot,
their arms crossed, and they shall be whipped in the
procession by the bishop or parish priest. Similarly
shall they repair to the Cathedral on Ash Wednesday
in their shirts, barefoot, their arms crossed, and submit
to banishment from church for all Lent; so that
during that season they must remain at the church
door and hear the service thence. On Thursday in
Holy Week they shall come to the church to be reconciled
in accordance with the canonical provisions, it
being understood that this penance of remaining out
of the church through Lent and of being whipped in
procession on the days appointed shall be performed
yearly for the remainder of the penitents’ lives.”</p>

<p>At first, and down to Eymeric’s day, the <i>sanbenito</i>
preserved its original form&mdash;a tunic similar to that
worn by the members of regular orders. But in the
fourteenth century it was altered to a scapulary or
tabard, with an opening at the top through which the
head was passed; it was to be of the full width of the
body, and to descend no lower than the knees, lest it
should too closely resemble the scapulary which the
regulars wore in addition to their tunic. Soon after
it was resolved that it should be of yellow sackcloth,
and that the crosses should be red.</p>

<p>Once this stage was reached, it may be said that
the transition from a garment solely of penitence into
a garment chiefly of shame and infamy was complete.</p>

From Limborch’s “Historia Inquisitionis.”</p>
</div>

<p>We have said that the imposition of the <i>sanbenito</i>
had been falling into desuetude during the fifteenth
century. But for Torquemada it might indeed have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
become entirely obsolete. It happened, however, that
the Prior of Holy Cross perceived the virtues of it,
the salutary results to be obtained from parading the
victims of the Holy Office in that hideous garb.
Therefore he revived it, and strongly enjoined its use
by all offenders save those against whom there was no
more than evil reputation, and who submitted themselves
to be purged of this canonically.</p>

<p>It was not, however, until the famous Ximenes de
Cisneros, who became Grand Inquisitor some ten
years after Torquemada’s death&mdash;that the <i>sanbenito</i>
attained its full development, the form which it was
to preserve until the extinction of the Inquisition.</p>

<p>Cisneros substituted for the ordinary rectangular
cross worn on back and breast of the <i>sanbenito</i> an
<i>aspa</i>, or St. Andrew’s cross, and he otherwise disposed
that the <i>sanbenito</i> might proclaim the offence
and sentence of its wearer. Three varieties were
devised for those who were abjuring a heresy of
which they had incurred suspicion: the suspect of the
degree <i>leviter</i> wore a perfectly plain <i>sanbenito</i> without
any cross or other device; the suspect <i>vehementer</i>
wore upon back and breast one arm only of the
St. Andrew’s cross; the suspect <i>violenter</i> was made to
wear the full cross.</p>

<p>Those actually convicted of heresy wore in addition
to the <i>sanbenito</i> a tall mitre, or pyramidal cap, made of
cardboard and covered with yellow sackcloth; and that
their precise condition might be distinguished, the
following differentiations were prescribed: the heretic
who repented before the passing of sentence, and
who&mdash;not being a relapsed&mdash;was not to die by fire,
bore upon the breast and back of his <i>sanbenito</i> and
upon the front and back of his <i>coroza</i>, as the mitre
was called, a full St. Andrew’s cross; the relapsed
heretic who had repented before the Auto bore, in
addition to the crosses, the device of a bust upon
burning faggots on the nether part of his <i>sanbenito</i>;
further his <i>sanbenito</i> and <i>coroza</i> were flecked with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
tongues of flame, which pointed downwards to signify
that he was not to die by fire, although his body was
to be burnt. He had deserved the charity of being
strangled at the stake before the faggots were ignited.
And this mercy, be it added, the Holy Office conceded
to any heretic who at the eleventh hour
confessed his guilt and desired to make his peace
with the Church and die, as it were, upon her loving
bosom. To this end the condemned was accompanied
from the Auto to the stake by two friars, who never
ceased to exhort him to make confession, save his
body from the temporal torment of physical fire, and
his soul from the eternal torment of spiritual fire.</p>

<p>Finally, the impenitent heretic bore the same
devices as the relapsed penitent, but in his case the
tongues of flame pointed upwards to show that he was
to die by them, and his <i>sanbenito</i> was further daubed
with crude paintings of devils&mdash;horrible, grotesque
caricatures&mdash;to advertise the spirits ruling over his soul.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Something should by now have been gathered of
the spirit of the Inquisition as reflected in the pages
of Eymeric and his commentator Pegna in that
“Directorium” upon which such copious draught has
been made for these chapters upon the Jurisprudence
of the Holy Office. It is worth while, before proceeding,
to cite another author’s views upon Justice
and Mercy as understood by the Inquisition, and to
consider an illuminating passage from the pen of
Garcia de Trasmiera.</p>

<p>This Trasmiera&mdash;to whom reference has been
made already&mdash;was an Aragonese, an inquisitor who
lived in the seventeenth century&mdash;nearly two hundred
years after the epoch with which we are here concerned.
We might go to a score of other sources, from Paramo
downwards, for very similar sentiments, and the only
reason for choosing this particular passage from
Trasmiera is that it is almost in the nature of an
epitome.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span></p>

<p>He seems to summarize the very arguments with
which Torquemada and his delegates convinced themselves
not merely of the righteousness, but of the
inevitability&mdash;if they were to do their duty by God
and man, and fulfil the destinies for which they had
been sent into this world&mdash;of the task to which they
had set their hands.</p>

<p>“These two virtues of Mercy and Justice,” says
the Aragonese writer, with all the authority of an
Evangelist, “are so closely united in God, although
we imperfectly judge them to be opposed, that Divine
Wisdom but avails Itself of the one, the more gloriously
to exercise the other. The most proper effect of the
Divine Mercy, none doubts, is the salvation of souls,
and who can doubt that what in this court of the
Inquisition appears to be rigour of Justice is really
medicine prescribed by Mercy for the good of the
delinquents? Just as it would be a barbarous judgment
to attribute to cruelty on the part of the surgeon
the cautery of fire which he employs to destroy the
contagious cancer of the patient, so it would be crass
ignorance to suppose that these laws which appear to
be severities are prescribed for any purpose other than
that which governs the surgeon in curing his patient,
or a father in punishing his child. Says the Holy
Ghost: ‘Who does not use the rod hates the child,’
and elsewhere: ‘God punishes whom He loves.’”<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">126</a></p>

<p>Could perversity of interpretation go further? In
Rome, in Torquemada’s day, the Father of Christianity
was granting absolutions, commuting the punishment
of hanging to pecuniary penances where such penances
were solicited, and justifying such commutation by
reminding Christianity that God does not desire the
death of a sinner, but rather that he should live and
be converted.</p>

<p>It would seem as if Inquisitor and Pontiff did not
see eye to eye in this matter of Mercy and Justice.
To the credit of the Pontiff be it said.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span></p>

<p>Trasmiera, echoing the inquisitorial casuistry of
centuries, holds that the rigour of Justice is prescribed
by Mercy for the good of the delinquents. The
impenitent Judaizer was sent to the stake. How
could that redound to his good in this world or the
next? We could admit a certain logical consummation
of their arguments if the inquisitors had confined
themselves to burning those who repented, or those
who were innocent even; by burning these whilst
they were in a state of grace they would have ensured
their salvation by abstracting them from all perils of
future sin. But to burn the impenitent upon such
grounds as they themselves urged, believing, as they
did, that just as surely as his mortal part was burnt
there at the stake, just so surely would his immortal
part burn through all eternity in hell&mdash;that was, clearly,
by their own lights, to perpetrate the murder of his
soul.

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV<br />

<span class="medium">PEDRO ARBU&Eacute;S DE EPILA</span></h2>

<p>There is no difficulty in believing Llorente’s
statement&mdash;based upon extracts from contemporary
chronicles&mdash;to the effect that the Inquisition was not
looked upon with favour in Castile. It was impossible
that a civilized and enlightened people should view
with equanimity the institution of a tribunal whose
methods, however based fundamentally upon those
of the civil courts, were in the details of their practice
so opposed to all conceptions of equity.</p>

<p>In no Catholic country does the cherishing of a
fervent faith, in itself, imply respect for the clergy.
Nor, for that matter, does the respect of any religion
in itself signify respect for those who administer it. It
appears to do so; it is even prescribed that it should;
but in point of fact it seldom does, other than
with simple peasant classes. The ministers, after all,
are men; but by virtue of their office they labour
under disadvantages greater than the ordinary man’s.
When they display the failings to which all men are
subject, these failings wear a much graver aspect by
virtue of the office they hold and the greater purity
which that office implies. Holiness is looked upon
as the priest’s trade, and it is expected that he should
conduct that trade honestly, as any layman conducts
the affairs by which he earns his livelihood. The only
test of honesty in the priest, of whatever denomination,
lies in his own conduct; and when this falls
short of that high standard in which he claims to deal,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>
he earns a contempt akin to that which overtakes the
trader who defrauds his creditors. It is remembered
then, to his disadvantage, that under his cassock the
cleric is a man, and so subject to all the faults that are
man’s heritage. But it happens that in addition to
these he is subject to other failings that are peculiarly
of the cassock, failings which the world has never been
slow to discern in him. The worst of these is the
ecclesiastical arrogance, the sacerdotal pride which has
been manifested by priests of all cults, but which in
none is so intolerable as in the Christian, who expounds
a gospel of humility and self-abnegation. He is akin
to a feudal tyrant who grinds the faces of his serfs
whilst he lectures them upon the glories of democracy.</p>

<p>Of such priests Spain of the fifteenth century had
an abundant share. She knew them and mistrusted
them, and hence she mistrusted any organization of
theirs which should transcend the strict limits of their
office.</p>

<p>Now, the tribunal of the Inquisition laid itself
peculiarly open to this mistrust in consequence of the
secrecy of its proceedings&mdash;a secrecy, as we know,
greatly increased by the enactments of Torquemada.
Its trials were not conducted in open court; the
examination of witnesses took place in secret and
under the veil of anonymity, so that the world had
no assurance of the honesty of the proceedings. When
it happened that a man was arrested, the world, as a
rule, knew him no more until he came forth, candle in
hand, arrayed in a <i>sanbenito</i> to play his tragic part in
an Auto.</p>

<p>By virtue of this secrecy the Inquisition had invested
itself with a power far greater, more subtle, and
farther-reaching than that of any civil court. The
might of the Grand Inquisitor was almost boundless,
and he was unanswerable to any temporal authority for
the arbitrariness with which he exercised it. Rivalling
the sovereign power in much, in much else the Grand
Inquisitor’s went above and beyond it, for not even the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>
King himself could interfere in matters of the Faith
with one who held his office directly from the Pope.</p>

<p>The net which Torquemada cast was of the very
widest; the meshes of that net were of the closest,
so that no man, however humble, could account himself
safe; its threads were of the strongest, so that
no man, however powerful, could be sure of breaking
through were he once brought within its scope.</p>

<p>What, then, but terror could Torquemada and his
grim machinery inspire? It is not difficult to believe
the sometime secretary of the Inquisition when he
assures us that the Holy Office was not favourably
viewed in Spain. The marvel is that whilst the
Castilians were chilled by awe into inactivity and meek
submission, it should have remained for Aragon,
which already had known an inquisition for a century,
to rise up in rebellion.</p>

<p>And yet what may seem at first glance a reason why
Aragon should have submitted to Torquemada’s rule
in matters of the Faith, may be the very reason of its
rash and futile rebellion. For a hundred years already
the court of the Holy Office had been operating there;
but its operations, never vigorous, had become otiose.
In this inactive form Aragon had suffered it to continue.
But of a sudden it was roused from that lethargy
by Torquemada. It was bidden to enforce its stern
decrees and other sterner decrees which he added to
those already in existence, and to follow the course of
arbitrary procedure which he laid down. Never welcome
in Aragon, it now became intolerable. The
New-Christians, who knew the fate of their Castilian
brethren, went with fear in their countenances, and
despair and its fierce courage in their hearts.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1484 Ferdinand held his Cortes
at Tarragona. He was attended on the occasion by
Torquemada, and he seized the opportunity to present
to his kingdom the gaunt Prior of Holy Cross, its
pontifically-appointed Grand Inquisitor.</p>

<p>Torquemada’s activity matched his boundless zeal.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>
At once he convened a council composed of the Vice-Chancellor
of Aragon, Alonso de Caballeria&mdash;himself
a New-Christian&mdash;the Royal Councillor Alonso
Carillo, and some doctors of canon law, that they
might decide upon the course to be adopted in Aragon
to the end that the Inquisition might be conducted
with absolute uniformity there, as in Castile. This
done, he proceeded to appoint inquisitors to the Archbishopric
of Zaragoza, and his choice fell upon Frey
Gaspar Yuglar and Frey Pedro Arbu&eacute;s de Epila, Master
of Theology and Canon of the Metropolitan Church
of Zaragoza.</p>

<p>After the publication of the “Instructions” drawn
up that same year in Seville, Torquemada further
appointed to the Holy Office of Zaragoza a fiscal
advocate, an apparitor, notaries, and receivers, whereupon
that office began immediately to exercise its
functions under the new system.</p>

<p>At once the courage of despair roused the New-Christians
to opposition. Amongst them were many
who held high positions at court, persons of great
influence and esteem, and these immediately determined
to send a deputation to the Vatican and another
to the Sovereigns to voice their protests against the
institution of this tribunal in Aragon, and to beseech
that it be abolished, or at least curtailed in its powers
and inhibited from proceeding to confiscation, which
was contrary to the law of the land.</p>

<p>This last was a shrewd request, based no doubt
upon the conviction that, deprived of the confiscations
upon which it battened, the tribunal must languish and
very soon return to its former inoperative condition.</p>

<p>Nor were the <i>conversos</i> the only ones to denounce
the procedure of the Holy Office. Zurita records that
many of the principal nobles of Aragon rebelled against
it, protesting that it was against the liberties of the
kingdom to confiscate the property of men who were
never allowed to learn the names of those who bore
witness against them.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span></p>

<p>As well might they have appealed against death&mdash;for
death itself was not more irresistible or inexorable
than Torquemada. All the fruit borne by their labours
was that those who had lent their names to the petition
were ultimately prosecuted as hinderers of the Holy
Office. But this did not immediately happen.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile Torquemada’s delegates, Arbu&eacute;s
and Yuglar, went about the business entrusted to them
with that imperturbability which the “Directorium”
enjoins. They published their edicts, ordered arrests,
carried out confiscations, and proceeded with such
thoroughness that it was not long before Zaragoza
began to present the same lurid, ghastly spectacles
that were to be witnessed in the chief cities of Castile.</p>

<p>In the following May (1485) they celebrated with
great solemnity the first Auto de F&eacute;, penancing many
and burning some. This was followed by a second
Auto in June.</p>

<p>The despair and irritation of the New-Christians
mounted higher at these spectacles. It is believed
to have reached its climax with the sudden arrest of
Leonardi Eli, one of the most influential, wealthy, and
respected <i>conversos</i> of Zaragoza.</p>

<p>Those who had put the petition afoot, abandoning
now all hope of obtaining any response either from
the Sovereigns or from Rome, met to concert other
measures. Their leader was a man of influence named
Juan Pedro Sanchez. He had four brothers in influential
positions at Court, who had lent their services
in the matter of the petition to the Sovereigns.</p>

<p>A meeting took place in the house of one Luis
de Santangel, and Sanchez urged a desperate remedy
for their desperate ills. They must strike terror into
their terrorizers. He proposed no less than the
slaughter of the inquisitors, urging with confidence
that if they were slain no others would dare to fill
their places. In this he seems to have underestimated
the character of Torquemada.</p>

<p>The proposal was adopted, an oath of secrecy was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
pledged, plans were laid, measures were taken, and
funds were collected to enable these plans to be executed.
Six assassins were chosen, among whom were
Juan de Abadia and his Gascon servant Vidal de
Uranso, and Juan de Esperandeu. This last was
the son of a <i>converso</i> then lying in the prisons of the
Inquisition, whose property had already been confiscated;
so that he was driven by the added spur
of personal revenge. There was, too, the further
incentive of a sum of five hundred florins promised
by the conspirators to the slayer of Arbu&eacute;s, and
deposited by them for that purpose with Juan Pedro
Sanchez.<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">127</a></p>

<p>Several early attempts to execute this project were
baffled by circumstances. It would seem, moreover,
that Arbu&eacute;s had received some warning of what was
in store for him&mdash;or else he was simply conscious of
the general hatred he had incurred&mdash;for he exercised
the greatest prudence, took to wearing body armour,
and was careful not to expose himself in any way; all
of which does not suggest in him that eagerness for
the martyr’s crown with which his biographer Trasmiera
would have us believe that he was imbued.</p>

<p>At last, however, the assassins found their opportunity.
Late on the night of September 15 of that
year, 1485, they penetrated into the Metropolitan
Church to lie in wait for their victims when these
should come to the midnight office imposed by the
rule of their order.</p>

<p>Juan de Abadia, with his Gascon servant Uranso
and another, entered by the main door. Esperandeu
and his companions gained admittance through the
sacristy.</p>

<p>About the pillars of the vast church, in the gloom
that was scarcely relieved by the altar-lamp, they
waited silently, “like bloody wolves,” says Trasmiera,
“for the coming of that gentle lamb.”</p>

<p>Towards midnight there was a stir overhead;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>
lights beat faintly upon the darkness; the canons
were assembling for matins in the choir.</p>

<p>A note of the organ boomed through the silence,
and then Arbu&eacute;s entered the church from the cloisters.</p>

<p>It seemed that even now chance did not favour
them, for Arbu&eacute;s came alone, and their aim was to
take both the inquisitors.</p>

<p>The dominican was on his way to join his brethren
in the choir. He carried a lantern in one hand and
a long bludgeon in the other. Nor did his precautions
end in this. He wore a shirt of mail under his white
habit, and there was a steel lining to his black velvet
skull-cap. He must indeed have gone in fear, that
he could not trust himself to matins save armed at
all points.</p>

<p>He crossed the nave on his way to the staircase leading
to the choir. But as he reached the pulpit on the
left he halted and knelt to offer up the prescribed prayer
in adoration of the Sanctissimum Sacramentum. He
set the lantern down upon the ground beside him,
and leant his club against a pillar.</p>

<p>Now was the assassins’ opportunity. He was at
their mercy. And although to strike now was to
leave half their task undone, they must have resolved
that rather than postpone the matter again in the
hope of slaying both inquisitors, they had better take
the one that was delivered up to them.</p>

<p>The chanting overhead muffled the sound of their
steps as they crept up behind Arbu&eacute;s, out of the blackness
into the faint wheel of yellow light cast by his
lantern.</p>

<p>Esperandeu was the first to strike, and he struck
clumsily, doing no more than wound the inquisitor in
the left arm. But swift upon that blow followed
another from Uranso&mdash;a blow so violent that it
smashed part of the steel cap, and, presumably
glancing off, opened a wound in the inquisitor’s neck,
which is believed to have been the real cause of his
death.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span></p>

<p>It did not, however, at that moment incapacitate
him. He staggered up, and turned to the staircase
that led to the choir. But now Esperandeu returned
to the assault, and drove at the Dominican so furiously
with his sword that, despite the shirt of mail with
which Arbu&eacute;s was protected, the blade went through
him from side to side.</p>

<p>The inquisitor fell, and lay still. The organ
ceased abruptly, and the assassins fled.</p>

<p>There was confusion now in the choir. Down
the stairs came the friars with their lanterns, to
discover the unconscious and bleeding inquisitor.
They took him up and carried him to bed. He died
forty-eight hours later at midnight on Saturday,
September 17, 1485.<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">128</a></p>

<p>By morning all the town had heard of the deed,
and the effect which it produced was very different
from that for which its perpetrators had hoped. The
Old-Christians, some moved by religious zeal, some
by a sense of justice, snatched up weapons and went
forth to the cry of “To the fire with the <i>conversos</i>!”</p>

<p>The populace&mdash;an uncertain quantity, ever ready
to be swayed by the first voice that is loud enough,
to follow the first leader who points the way&mdash;took
up the cry, and soon Zaragoza was in turmoil.
Through every street rang the clamours of the multitude,
which threatened to offer up one of those hecatombs
in which fire disputes with steel the horrid
laurel of the day.</p>

<p>The uproar penetrated to the Palace of Alfonso
of Aragon, the seventeen-year-old Archbishop of
Zaragoza. It roused that bastard of Catholic Ferdinand
from his slumbers. A high-spirited lad, he summoned
the grandees of the city and the officers of justice,
and rode out at their head to meet and quell the
rioters. But only by a promise that the fullest justice
should be done upon the murderers did he succeed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>
in dispersing them and restoring order to that distracted
city.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“Divine Justice,” says Trasmiera, “permitted the
deed, but not its impunity.”</p>

<p>Rash indeed had been the action of the New-Christians,
and terrible was the penalty exacted,
terrible the price they were made to pay for the life
they had taken. In conceiving that they could intimidate
by such an act a man of Torquemada’s mettle,
they displayed a lamentable want of judgment, as
was speedily proved. To fill the place of the dead
inquisitor, and to set about the stern business of
avenging him, Torquemada instantly dispatched to
Zaragoza Fr. Juan Colvera, Fr. Pedro de Monterubio,
and Dr. Alonso de Alarcon. For the greater security
of themselves and their prisoners, these delegates set
up their tribunal in the royal alcazar of the Castle of
Aljaferia, and proceeded to institute an active search
for the culprits. Several were seized, amongst whom
was Abadia’s servant, Vidal de Uranso. He was put to
the question, and an admission of his own guilt extracted
from him. He was tortured further in the endeavour
to wring from him the names of his associates in the
deed, and finally he was promised “grace” if he
would divulge them.</p>

<p>At this price the unfortunate Gascon consented to
speak, betraying all whom he had known to be in the
plot and all whom he had known to sympathize with
it. And Llorente, who saw the records of the proceedings,
tells us that when Uranso claimed the
promised grace, he was benignly answered that he
should receive the grace of not having his hands
hacked off&mdash;as must the others&mdash;before being hanged,
drawn, and quartered.</p>

<p>Amongst those taken were Juan de Abadia, Juan
de Esperandeu, and Luis de Santangel.</p>

<p>Esperandeu and Uranso suffered together at the
Auto of June 30, 1486&mdash;the seventh held in Zaragoza
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
that year. Esperandeu was dragged through the city
on a hurdle, his hands were hacked off on the steps of
the Cathedral, whereafter he was hanged, drawn, and
quartered. Five other conspirators suffered in the
same Auto, being abandoned to the secular arm and
burnt alive. Two others, who had escaped, were
burnt in effigy, and one of these was that Juan Pedro
Sanchez who had been the leading spirit in the affair.
And together with these living men and the grotesque
effigies of straw arrayed in <i>sanbenito</i> and <i>coroza</i> they
burnt the corpse of Juan de Abadia. He had cheated
in part the Justice of the Holy Office. He had committed
suicide in prison by eating a glass lamp.<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">129</a></p>

<p>Autos succeeded one another at such a rate now in
Zaragoza that no less than fourteen were held in that
year 1486; 42 persons were burnt alive, 14 in effigy, and
134 were penanced in varying degrees from perpetual
imprisonment to public whippings. And to the end
that the publicity of these Autos might be increased
and the salutary lesson inculcated by them might be
as far-reaching as possible, Torquemada ordered that
a fortnight before the holding of each it should be
announced by public proclamation, with great solemnity
and parade of mounted familiars of the Holy Office&mdash;a
matter which upon this precedent became customary
throughout Spain.</p>

<p>In his allusion to these Autos Trasmiera<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">130</a> advances
one of the usual sophistries employed by the Inquisition
to justify its constant claim that its proceedings were
dictated by mercy.</p>

<p>He assures us that it was a happiness (<i>dicha</i>) for
the culprits to die so soon, and he explains that to
have allowed them to live would have shown a greater
rigour of justice&mdash;“as witnesseth Cain, upon whom
God placed a sign ordering that none should kill him
since by the prolongation of his life, his nature being
what it was, he must commit more sins, and thus more
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
surely deserve greater degrees of punishment in his
eternal damnation.”</p>

<p>It is a priest who puts forward this blasphemous
assertion that God desires the damnation of a sinner,
and suggests that by burning that sinner betimes, God
is to be cheated&mdash;at least in part&mdash;of His unspeakable
purpose. It serves excellently to show to what desperate
shifts of argument men could be urged in the
attempt to justify the practices of the Holy Office.</p>

<p>With precisely the same degree of authority does
he assure us that all the murderers died penitent&mdash;in
consequence of the affectionate prayers offered up for
them by Arbu&eacute;s in the hour of his death.</p>

<p>Vidal de Uranso’s confession had yielded up to the
inquisitors the names not only of participators in the
murder of Arbu&eacute;s, but of those who were believed by
the Gascon to be in sympathy with the deed. By
pursuing the methods peculiarly their own to cause a
prosecution to spread like an oil-stain, slowly and
surely covering an ever-widening area, the inquisitors
were able to cause the indictment of many whose
connection with the crime was of the remotest, and of
others who, moved by a very Christian pity, had
afforded shelter to New-Christians fleeing in terror
before the blind vengeance of the Holy Office. Among
the latter many were prosecuted where there was
no proof that the fugitives they had sheltered were
Judaizers or unfaithful. It is believed that sheer panic
had driven many perfectly innocent New-Christians to
depart from a city where no New-Christian might
account himself secure. But in consequence of the
clause introduced by the merciless Torquemada into his
“Instructions,” a man’s flight was in itself a sufficient
reason for the presumption of his guilt.</p>

<p>A reign of terror was established in Zaragoza.
The tribunal of that city became one of the busiest in
Spain, and it is computed that altogether some two
hundred victims paid in one way and another for the
death of Pedro Arbu&eacute;s, so that there was hardly a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
family, noble or simple, that was not plunged into
mourning by the Justice of the Faith.</p>

<p>Amongst those against whom proceedings were
instituted were men of the very first importance in
the kingdom. One of these was that Alonso de
Caballeria, Vice-Chancellor of Aragon, who had been
prominent in the council summoned by Torquemada
to determine the details of the introduction of the
Inquisition into Aragon. Nor did they confine their
attention to New-Christians. Amongst those they
summoned to render to the Holy Office an account
of their deeds we find no less a person than Don Jaime
de Navarre, known as the Infante of Navarre or the
Infante of Tudela, the son of the Queen of Navarre,
and King Ferdinand’s own nephew.</p>

<p>A fugitive New-Christian coming to Tudela cast
himself upon the mercy of the prince, and found
shelter in Navarre for a few days until he could escape
into France. The inquisitors, whom nothing escaped,
had knowledge of this, and such was their might and
arrogance that they did not hesitate to arrest the
Infante in the capital of his mother’s independent
kingdom. They haled this prince of the blood-royal
to Zaragoza to stand his trial upon the charge of
hindering the Holy Office. They cast him into
prison, and subjected him to the humiliating penance
of being whipped round the Metropolitan Church by
two priests in the presence of his bastard cousin, the
seventeen-year old Archbishop, Alfonso of Aragon.
Thereafter he was made to stand penitentially, candle
in hand, in view of all during High Mass, before he
could earn absolution of the ecclesiastical censure he
had incurred.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Alonso de Caballeria is one of the few men in
history who was able successfully to defy and withstand
the terrible power of that sacerdotal court.</p>

<p>This Vice-Chancellor was a man of great ability,
the son of a wealthy baptized Hebrew nobleman,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
whose name had been Bonafos, but who had changed
this to Caballeria upon receiving baptism, in accordance
with the prevailing custom. He was arrested
not only upon the charge of having given shelter to
fugitives, but also upon suspicion of being, himself,
a Judaizer.</p>

<p>Presuming upon his high position, and also upon
the great esteem in which he was held by his king,
Caballeria showed the Inquisition an intrepid countenance.
He refused to recognize the authority of the
court and of Torquemada himself, appealing to the
Pope, and including in his appeal a strong complaint
of the conduct of the inquisitors.</p>

<p>This appeal was of such a character and the man’s
own position was so strong that on August 28, 1488,
Innocent VIII dispatched a brief inhibiting the inquisitors
from proceeding further against the Vice-Chancellor,
and avocating to himself the case. But
such was Torquemada’s arrogance by now that he
was no longer to be intimidated by papal briefs.
Under his directions the inquisitors of Zaragoza
replied that the allegations contained in Caballeria’s
appeal were false. The Pope, however, was insistent,
and he compelled the Holy Office to bow to his will
and supreme authority. On October 20 of that year
the minutes of the case were forwarded to the Vatican.
As a result of their perusal His Holiness must have
absolved Caballeria, for not only was he delivered
of the peril in which he had stood, but he continued
to rise steadily in honour and consequence until he
became Chief Judge and head of the Hermandad of
Aragon.<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">131</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Llorente informs us<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">132</a> that he perused the records
of some thirty trials in connection with the Arbu&eacute;s
affair, and that the publication of any one of them
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
would suffice to render the Inquisition detested, were
it not sufficiently detested already in all civilized
countries, including Spain.</p>

<p>He mentions, however, two cases of interest and
importance,<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">133</a> to show how arbitrary was the spirit of
the Inquisition, and how far-reaching its arm.</p>

<p>Juan Pedro Sanchez, the leader of the affair, having
fled to Toulouse, was, as we have seen, sentenced as
contumacious and burnt in effigy pending the seizure
of his person.</p>

<p>In Toulouse at this time there was a student named
Antonio Agustin, a member of an illustrious family of
Aragon and a man destined to rise to great dignity
and honour. Under the impulse of fanaticism, and
acting in conjunction with several other Spaniards in
Toulouse, he petitioned for the arrest of Sanchez.
When this had been effected, he indited a letter to the
inquisitors of Aragon, and forwarded it to his brother
Pedro in Zaragoza for delivery.</p>

<p>Pedro, however, first discussed the matter with
Guillerme Sanchez, brother of the fugitive, and three
friends, and all were opposed to Agustin’s purpose.
They decided not to deliver the letter, and they wrote
to Agustin begging him to withdraw his plea against
Sanchez and consent to the fugitive’s being restored
to liberty.</p>

<p>Agustin was persuaded, and replied informing his
brother that he had done as they had requested. Once
Pedro Agustin in Zaragoza was assured of this, he
delivered the letters to the inquisitors&mdash;though why he
should have done so is not by any means clear.
Possibly he conceived that this was the wisest course
to pursue, lest it should afterwards transpire that he
had suppressed such a communication. But from what
follows it will be seen how ill-advised he was.</p>

<p>The Holy Office having received the letters, and
supposing Juan Pedro Sanchez still under arrest in
Toulouse, ordered him to be brought to Zaragoza.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>
The courts of Toulouse replied that he had already
been released and that his whereabouts were now
unknown.</p>

<p>The inquisitors inquired into the matter with that
terrible thoroughness of which they commanded the
means. They controlled the most wonderful police
system that the world has ever seen. A vast civilian
army was enrolled in the service of the Holy Office,
as members of the tertiary order of St. Dominic.
These were the lay brothers of the family, and as the
position conferred upon those who held it certain signal
benefits, of which immunity from taxation was one,<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">134</a>
it will be understood that their number had to be
limited, so very considerable were the applications for
enrolment.</p>

<p>Originally this had been a penitential order, but
very quickly it came to be known as the Militia Christi,
and its members as familiars of the Holy Office&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>
part of the family of St. Dominic. They dressed in
black, and wore the white cross of St. Dominic upon
their doublets and cloaks, and they were made to join
the Confraternity of St. Peter Martyr. The inquisitors
seldom went abroad without an escort of these armed
lay-brothers.</p>

<p>In the ranks of the Militia Christi were to be found
men of all professions, dignities, and callings. They
formed the secret police of the Inquisition, they were
the eyes and ears of the Holy Office, ubiquitous in
every stratum of social life.</p>

<p>Through these agents the inquisitors were not long
in ascertaining what had taken place in the matter of
Juan Pedro Sanchez, and soon the five friends were
under arrest and forced to answer the serious charge
of hindering the Holy Office.</p>

<p>They were paraded in public in the Auto of
May 6, 1487, as suspects&mdash;<i>leviter</i>&mdash;of Judaizing; they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
were penanced to stand in full view of the people,
candle in hand and wearing the <i>sanbenito</i>, during
Mass, and they were thereafter disqualified from holding
any office or benefice or pursuing any honourable
profession during the good pleasure of the inquisitors.</p>

<p>As it was, they escaped lightly. That they were
suspected <i>leviter</i> of Judaizing, shows us how easily that
suspicion might be incurred. It was purely constructive
in this instance&mdash;an inference to be drawn from
the fact that they had befriended a Judaizer who was
under sentence.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The other case is far more horrible. It shows in
operation Torquemada’s decree regarding the children
of heretics, and reveals in the fullest measure its appalling
inhumanity.</p>

<p>Another who had fled to Toulouse, fearing implication
in the affair of the murder of Arbu&eacute;s, was one
Gaspar de Santa Cruz. It happened that he died
there, after having been sentenced as contumacious
and burnt in effigy at Zaragoza. It came to the ears
of the inquisitors that he had been assisted in his
flight by his son; and not content with the heavy
punishment of infamy that must fall automatically upon
that son for sins that were not his own, not content
with having reduced him to destitution by confiscating
his inheritance and by disqualifying him from office,
benefice, or honourable employment, they now seized
his person and indicted him for hindering.</p>

<p>Arrayed in a yellow <i>sanbenito</i>, this son, who had
discharged by his father the sacrosanct duty which
nature and humanity impose, was exhibited to scorn in
an Auto, and further penanced by being compelled to
come before the court of the Holy Office and testify
to his father’s contumacious flight. Nor did that
ghoulish tribunal count itself satisfied even then. It
was further imposed upon him that he must repair to
Toulouse, exhume his father’s remains, and publicly
burn them, returning to Zaragoza with a properly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>
attested report of the performance, when he should
receive absolution of the censures incurred.</p>

<p>Santa Cruz carried out that barbarous command, as
the only means of saving his liberty and perhaps his
life. For it is certain that had he refused, it would
have been argued that he had rejected the offered
means of reconciliation with the Church he had so
grievously offended, and he would have been prosecuted
as impenitent; whilst had he availed himself of
the only alternative and fled, he must have been
sentenced as contumacious and would have gone to
the stake if he were ever taken.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>From the hour of his death Pedro Arbu&eacute;s de Epila
was looked upon as a saint and martyr, the notion
being carefully fostered by the members of his order
in the minds of the faithful.</p>

<p>And, as is usual in such cases, miraculous manifestations
of his sanctity are alleged to have begun in the
very hour of his death. Trasmiera tells us that the
bells rang of themselves when he died, and he opines
that this serves to approve their use in a time when
Luther and others were condemning them as vain.</p>

<p>The blood of the inquisitor, we learn from the
same source, boiled upon the stones of the church
where it had fallen, and continued to do so for a fortnight
afterwards; whilst on any of the twelve days
immediately following the night of his murder, a
handkerchief pressed to the stones upon which his
blood had been shed, when removed, was found to be
blood-stained.</p>

<p>These, says Trasmiera, were miracles of which all
were witnesses. There is much more of the same kind&mdash;including
an account of the inquisitor’s apparitions after
death, as testified by Mosen Blanco, to whom the ghost
appeared, and with whom it conversed at length&mdash;to
be found in Trasmiera’s “Vida y Muerte del Venerable
Inquisidor, Pedro Arbu&eacute;s.”</p>

<p>The sword with which he was slain was preserved
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
in the Metropolitan Church of Zaragoza, a relic sanctified
by the blood that had embrued it.</p>

<p>He was buried in the same church, and on the spot
where he fell Isabella raised a beautiful monument to
his memory in 1487. Part of its inscription ran:
“Happy Zaragoza! Rejoice that here is buried he
who is the glory of the martyrs.”</p>

<p>He was beatified two hundred years later by
Alexander VII, largely in consequence of the efforts
of the Spanish inquisitors, who perceived what an
added prestige it would give their order if one of its
members were worshipped as a martyr. His canonization
followed in the nineteenth century. It was effected
by Pope Pius IX, and was the subject of much derisory
comment in the Rome of that day, which had just
broken the shackles of clerical government that had
trammelled it for some fifteen hundred years.

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV<br />

<span class="medium">TORQUEMADA’S FURTHER “INSTRUCTIONS”</span></h2>

<p>The intrepid but ineffectual resistance offered by
Zaragoza to the Inquisition was emulated by the
principal cities of Aragon; one and all protested
against the institution of this tribunal under the new
form which Torquemada had given it.</p>

<p>But nowhere was resistance of the least avail
against the iron purpose of the Grand Inquisitor,
armed with the entire force of civil justice to constrain
the people into submission to the ecclesiastical
will.</p>

<p>Teruel had been thrown into open revolt by the
proposal to appoint inquisitors there; and so fierce
and determined was the armed resistance, that not
until the King’s troops made their appearance in the
streets of that city, in March 1485, were order and
obedience restored.</p>

<p>In Valencia, too, there was a vigorous opposition
led by the nobles, and throughout Catalu&ntilde;a the resistance
was so resolute that it was not until two years
later that the Sovereigns were able to reduce the
people to submission.</p>

<p>Barcelona urged an ancient right to appoint her
own inquisitors, and refused persistently and angrily
to recognize the authority of Torquemada or his delegates,
in spite of any bulls that might have been issued
by Sixtus IV and Innocent VIII. Nor was this city’s
obstinacy conquered until 1487, after Pope Innocent
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>
had issued his second bull, confirming Torquemada in
the office of Grand Inquisitor of Castile, Leon, Aragon,
and Valencia, and further extending his jurisdiction so
that it included all the Spains&mdash;in which bull he formally
cancelled the ancient rights of Barcelona to
appoint her own inquisitors.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It should be sufficiently clear from this that, notwithstanding
the racial antipathy between Spaniard
and Jew, notwithstanding the religious spirit so very
ardent in the people of Spain, serving to aggravate
beyond all reason that hatred of the Israelite, the
Inquisition&mdash;as Torquemada understood and controlled
it&mdash;was very far from being desired by them. That
this grim institution should have contrived so firmly
to establish itself upon Spanish soil and to wield
there a power such as it wielded in no other Catholic
country of Europe, was due entirely to the brothers
of St. Dominic and the fanaticism of Torquemada
playing upon the bigotry and acquisitiveness of the
Sovereigns.</p>

<p>Assailants of the Roman Church have urged that
the Inquisition was a religious institution. Defenders
of that same Church, in their endeavour to shift so
terrible a burden from her shoulders, have sought to
show that the Inquisition was a political machine. It
was neither, and at the same time it was both. But
chiefly and primarily it was just a clerical weapon.
And clericalism in the Iberian Peninsula, pervaded by
the spirit of Torquemada, converted that institution
into an instrument far more dreadful and oppressive
than was its character in Italy, or France, or any other
Roman Catholic country of the world in which the
Holy Office held jurisdiction.</p>

<p>In Spain it had set up in the evening of the
fifteenth century an absolute reign of terror, depriving
men of all liberty of conscience and of speech
and spreading a network of espionage over the face of
the land.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span></p>

<p>And in the meantime, practice having brought to
light certain shortcomings in the decrees which he had
already issued, Torquemada added a further eleven
articles in 1485. In the main, however, these are
concerned with the internal affairs of the Holy Office
rather than with its attitude towards offenders.</p>

<p>Articles I and II provide for the payment of officers
of the Inquisition, and decree that no officer shall
receive gifts of any nature under pain of instant
dismissal.</p>

<p>Article III disposes that the inquisitors shall keep
a permanent agent in Rome, who shall be skilled in
the law, so that he may attend to matters appertaining
to the Holy Office.</p>

<p>From this it is to be inferred that appeals to the
Vatican continued to be numerous, notwithstanding
the provisions made by the Pope to constitute Torquemada
the supreme arbiter in matters of the Faith.</p>

<p>Articles V to XI are entirely concerned with details
relating to confiscations. These would be of no
particular interest, but that they serve to show how
vast by now was the business of confiscation, since the
manner of conducting it and disposing of confiscated
property should demand so many decrees to govern it.</p>

<p>Article IV is the only one that may be said to concern
the actual jurisprudence of the Holy Office.
This is intended not so much to soften the rigour as
to remove the inconveniences that might arise out of
Article X of the “Instructions” of 1484.</p>

<p>By that article it was decreed that confiscation
should be retrospective&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> that a heretic’s property
should be confiscate not from the day of the discovery
of his heresy, but from the date of the offence itself.
So that any property that might in the meantime have
been alienated&mdash;whether in the ordinary way of
commerce or otherwise&mdash;must be considered as the
property of the Holy Office, and was to be seized by
the Holy Office, no matter into whose hands it might
meanwhile have passed.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span></p>

<p>Such a decree, as will be seen, was proving a
serious hindrance to trade; for it became unsafe to
purchase anything from any one, since should either
party to the transaction subsequently be discovered to
have fallen into the sin of heresy prior to that transaction,
the other would be stripped of the acquired
property, and might be subjected to the entire loss.
Moreover, as proceedings were taken against the dead,
and as there was no limit imposed upon the retrospection
allowed to inquisitors, no man could account
himself safe from confiscations incurred through the
sin of some other from whom he or his forbears had
acquired the property.</p>

<p>The vagueness of this article urgently demanded
amending, and this was the purpose of Article IV of
the “Instructions” of 1485. It decreed that all contracts
concluded before 1479 should be accounted valid,
although it might come to be discovered against either
of the contracting parties that he was guilty of heresy
at the time of such contract.</p>

<p>This is the only instance in which we find
Torquemada promulgating a decree to soften the
rigour of any previous enactment, and it is very clear
that it is a decree dictated not by clemency but by
expediency.</p>

<p>In the event of fraud, or of any one being a party
to a fraud to abuse the privilege conferred by this
article, Torquemada provided that the offender, if
reconciled, should receive a hundred lashes and be
branded on the face with a hot iron; whilst, if not
reconciled&mdash;even though he should be a good Catholic&mdash;he
must suffer confiscation of all his property.<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">135</a></p>

<p>To justify the punishment of branding on the face,
the case of Cain is urged as a proper precedent, and
so modern a historian as Garcia Rodrigo does not
hesitate to put this seriously forward.<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">136</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span></p>

<p>Three years later&mdash;in 1488&mdash;Torquemada found it
necessary to add a further fifteen articles to his “Instructions,”
and we may anticipate a little by briefly
surveying their provisions at this stage.</p>

<p>Complaints to Rome of the injustices and the
excessive rigour of the inquisitors&mdash;a constant feature
of Torquemada’s Grand-Inquisitorship&mdash;had by that
time become so numerous that the Pope found it
necessary to order Torquemada to re-edit what
Amador de los Rios very aptly terms his “Code of
Terror.”<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">137</a></p>

<p>The chief ground of these complaints had concerned
the delays that so commonly occurred in
bringing an accused to trial. When a prisoner’s
acquittal ultimately chanced to take place, it was
after a long term of imprisonment for which there
was no compensation or redress; and when the
person so treated was a man of position and influence,
it is natural that he would protest strongly
against the treatment to which he had been subjected
before it was discovered that no charge could be
sustained against him. The real reason of these
delays must not be supposed to lie in dilatoriness or
sluggishness on the part of the inquisitors. Indeed,
the excessive dispatch with which they conducted
the affairs of their tribunal is a matter to the scandal
of which Llorente draws attention more than once&mdash;and
particularly in the course of chronicling the fact
that in the year of its introduction into Toledo this
court dealt&mdash;as we shall see&mdash;with no less than some
3,300 cases, 27 of the accused being burnt and the
remainder penanced in various degrees. He protests
with reason that it is utterly impossible that at such a
rate of procedure evidence can properly have been
sifted and any sort of justice done.</p>

<p>Where delays took place they were the result of
the extreme reluctance on the part of the Holy Office
to allow any to go free upon whom its talons had once
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>
fastened. Thus, when even the slight degree or
evidence necessary to enable the inquisitors to convict
was lacking, they would delay in the daily hope that
such evidence might be forthcoming, and by repeated
examinations they would meanwhile seek to force the
unfortunate prisoner into contradictions that should
justify them in resorting to torture.</p>

<p>In view of the explicit pontifical command, Torquemada
was compelled to amend this state of things,
at least in theory, by decreeing (Article III) that there
should be no delays in proceeding to trial through
lack of proof. Where proof was lacking, the accused
should at once be restored to liberty, since he could
at any time&mdash;when fresh proof was forthcoming&mdash;be
rearrested.</p>

<p>Similarly, with a view of expediting trials, he
ordered (Article IV) that since in all the courts of the
Inquisition there were not the necessary lawyers,
henceforth, when a case was completed, the <i>dossier</i>
of the proceedings should be sent to the Grand
Inquisitor himself, and he would then submit it to
the lawyers of the Suprema, who would advise
upon it.</p>

<p>But he amply made up for what softening of
rigour might be contained in these articles by the
greater severity enjoined in some of the other decrees
which he embodied in these “Instructions” of 1488.</p>

<p>Finding that the inquisitors of Aragon had been
departing from certain of his enactments of 1484,
diluting them with the weaker rules that had obtained
under the old Inquisition in that kingdom, he commanded
that all inquisitors should proceed in strict
obedience to the statutes contained in the past “Instructions.”</p>

<p>He provided (Article V) that the inquisitors should
themselves visit the prisons once in every fortnight,
but that no outsiders should be permitted to communicate
with the prisoners, save of course the priests
who would go to comfort them. To the end that a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>
still greater secrecy should be observed in the trials, he
commanded (Article VI) that when the depositions of
the witnesses were being taken none should be present
other than those who were by law absolutely necessary;
and he enjoined (Article VII) the safe and secret custody
of all documents relating to the cases tried.</p>

<p>We are left to gather that the harshness of his
enactment concerning the children of heretics had
been tempered a little by a natural humane pity which
did not at all commend itself to the pitiless Grand
Inquisitor; for we now find him (Article XI) enjoining
inquisitors to take care that the decree forbidding
those unfortunates the use of gold and silver and fine
garments, and disqualifying them from honourable
employment, should be rigorously enforced.</p>

<p>He provided (Article XIII) that all the expenses of
the Holy Office&mdash;which must have been enormous by
now, considering to what vast proportions he had
developed that organization&mdash;should be defrayed out
of confiscated property before this was surrendered to
the Royal treasury; and further (Article XV), that all
appointed notaries, fiscals, and constables should discharge
their functions in person and not by deputy.</p>

<p>The most interesting of these statutes of 1488, in
consequence of the information it conveys on the
subject of the activities of the Inquisition and the
enormous scale of the prosecutions upon which it was
engaged, is contained in Article XIV. The prisons of
Spain were becoming so crowded, and the expense
of maintaining the prisoners was imposing so heavy
a tax upon the Holy Office, that it had become
urgently necessary to make some fresh provision that
would relieve this burden. Therefore, as this article
sets forth, Torquemada enjoined the Sovereigns to
order the building in every district of the Inquisition
of a quadrangular enclosure of small houses (<i>casillas</i>)
for the residence of those sentenced to the penance of
imprisonment. These houses were to be so contrived
that the penitents might pursue in them their business
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
or trade and earn their own livelihood, thus relieving
the Inquisition of the heavy expense of supporting
them. Each of these quadrangular penitentiaries&mdash;for
this is the origin of the term&mdash;was to be equipped with

<span class="medium">THE INQUISITION IN TOLEDO</span></h2>

<p>Llorente, the historian of the Spanish Inquisition,
and M. Fidel Fita, the distinguished contributor to
the “Boletin de la Real Academia de la Historia,”
both had access to and both made use of a record left
by the licentiate Sebastian de Orozco, an eyewitness
of the establishment of the Inquisition in Toledo.
This has been printed verbatim by M. Fidel Fita.<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">139</a></p>

<p>The details afforded by Orozco are so circumstantial
that it is worth while to follow them closely,
since they may be said to afford a typical picture of
what was happening not only in the city with which
they are concerned, but throughout the whole of
Spain.</p>

<p>It was in May of the year 1485 that the Inquisition
was first set up in Toledo, that noble city
erected upon a rock that rises sheer from the swirling
waters of the Tagus, and is crowned by the royal palace
which still bears the Moorish name of Alcazar. It was
transferred thither, by Torquemada’s orders, from
Villa Real, where it had been operating for some
months.</p>

<p>“To the end that our Infinite Redeemer Jesus
Christ be praised in all that He does, and for the
greater power of His Holy Catholic Faith,” writes
Orozco, “know all who shall come after us that in the
year 1485, in the month of May, the Holy Inquisition
against heretical pravity was sent to this very noble
City of Toledo by our very enlightened Sovereigns,
Don Fernando and Donna Isabella.... Of this
Inquisition were administrators Vasco Ramirez de
Ribera, Archdeacon of Talavera, and Pedro Dias de
la Costana, Licentiate of Theology, and with them
one of the Queen’s Chaplains as fiscal and prosecutor,
and one Juan de Alfaro, a patrician of Seville, as chief
constable (<i>alguazil</i>), and two notaries.”</p>

<p>The licentiate Pedro Dias de la Costana preached
to the people on the third day of Pentecost (Tuesday,
May 24), notifying them of the papal bull under which
the inquisitors were acting and of the power vested in
these inquisitors to deal with matters of heresy; pronouncing
greater excommunication against any who
by word or deed or counsel should dare to oppose the
Inquisition in the execution of its duty.</p>

<p>At the conclusion of his announcement the
Gospels and a crucifix were brought, and upon these
all were required to make solemn oath of their desire
to serve God and the Sovereigns, to uphold the
Catholic Faith, and to defend and shelter the administrators
of the Holy Inquisition.</p>

<p>Lastly the licentiate published the usual edict of
grace for self-delators. He summons all Judaizers to
return to the Faith and become reconciled to the
Church within a term of forty days, as set forth by
the edict itself, which by his orders was nailed to the
door of the Cathedral.</p>

<p>A week elapsed without any response to this
summons. The <i>conversos</i> of Toledo had been preparing
to resist the introduction of the Inquisition to
their city, and under the guidance of one De la Torre
and some others they had already matured their plans
and laid down the lines which this resistance was to
take.</p>

From Limborch’s “Historia Inquisitionis.”</p>
</div>

<p>The plot was&mdash;according to Orozco, who, you will
have gathered, was an ardent partisan of the Holy
Office&mdash;that on the feast of Corpus Christi, which fell
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>
that year on June 2, the conspirators should be armed to
lie in wait for the procession, falling upon it as it was
advancing through the streets, and slaying the inquisitors
and their defenders. That done, they were
to seize the gates of the city and hold Toledo against
the King.</p>

<p>The fine strategic position of the city might have
lent itself to so daring a scheme, and presumably the
aim of the New-Christians would have been to hold it
rebelliously until accorded terms of capitulation that
should guarantee the immunity of the rebels from
all punishment, and the immunity of Toledo itself
from the jurisdiction of the Holy Office. But, on the
whole, it was so very crack-brained a conspiracy that
we are more than justified in doubting whether it ever
had any real existence.</p>

<p>“It pleased our Redeemer,” says Orozco, “that
this conspiracy was discovered on the eve of Corpus
Christi.” He does not satisfy our curiosity as to how
the discovery was made, and the omission increases
our doubts.</p>

<p>The details, we are told, were derived from several
of the plotters who were arrested on that day by the
Corregidor of Toledo, Gomes Manrique. In view
of the information thus obtained, Manrique proceeded
to capture De la Torre and four of his friends. One of
these captives, a cobbler named Lope Mauri&ccedil;o, the
Corregidor hanged out of hand on the morning of the
festival, before the procession had issued from the
Cathedral. The act may have been intended as a
deterrent to any who still entertained the notion of putting
the plot into execution.</p>

<p>The procession passed off without any disturbances;
and having hanged another of his prisoners Manrique
subjected the remainder to heavy fines, whereby they
escaped far more lightly than if they had been tried
by the court of the Holy Office. Fortunately for themselves,
it was deemed that their offence was one that
came within the jurisdiction of the secular courts.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span></p>

<p>Soon thereafter, possibly because they now realized
that they had nothing left to hope for, self-delators began
to come before the inquisitors to solicit reconciliation.</p>

<p>But when the term of the edict had expired, it
was found that the indefatigable Torquemada had
prepared a second one to supplement it. He ordered
the publication of an entirely fresh measure, commanding
that all who knew of any heretics, apostates, or
Judaizers, must, under pain of excommunication and
of being deemed heretics themselves, divulge to the
inquisitors the names of such offenders within a term
of sixty days.</p>

<p>There was already in existence an enactment of
the Inquisition, which instead of offering, as in all
times has been done by secular tribunals, a reward
for the apprehension of fugitives from justice, imposed
upon those who neglected spontaneously to set about
that catchpoll work when the occasion arose, a fine
of 500 ducats in addition to excommunicating them.
But Torquemada’s fresh measure went even beyond
that. Nor did it end with the edict we have mentioned.
When the sixty days expired, he ordered
the prolongation of the term by another thirty days&mdash;not
only in Toledo, but also in Seville, where he had
commanded the publication of the same edict&mdash;and
now came the cruellest measure of all. He commanded
the inquisitors to summon the Rabbis of the synagogues
and to compel them to swear according to
the Mosaic Law that they would denounce to the
inquisitors any baptized Jew whom they found returning
to the Jewish cult, and he made it a capital offence
for any Rabbi to keep such a matter secret.</p>

<p>Not even now did he consider that he had carried
far enough this infamous measure of persecution. He
ordained that the Rabbis should publish in their
synagogues an edict of excommunication by the
Mosaic Law against all Jews who should fail to
give information to the inquisitors of any Judaizing
whereof they might have knowledge.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span></p>

<p>In this decree we catch a glimpse of the intensity
of the fanatical, contemptuous hatred in which Torquemada
held the Israelites. For nothing short of blended
hatred and contempt could have inspired him so to
trample upon the feelings of their priests, and to compel
them under pain of death to a course in which they
must immolate their self-respect, violate their consciences,
and render themselves odious in the esteem
of every right-thinking Jew.</p>

<p>By this unspeakable enactment the very Jews
themselves were pressed into the secret service of
the Inquisition, and compelled by the fear of spiritual
and physical consequences to turn informers against
their brethren.</p>

<p>“Many,” says Orozco, who no doubt considered
it a measure as laudable as it was fiendishly astute,
“were the men and women who came to bear
witness.”</p>

<p>Arrests commenced at once, and were carried on
with an unprecedented activity revealed by the records
of the Autos that were held, which Orozco has
preserved for us.</p>

<p>And already fire had been set to the faggots piled
at the stake of Toledo, for the first victims had soon
fallen into the eager hands of the Inquisitors of the
Faith.</p>

<p>These were three men and their three wives,
natives of Villa Real, who had fled thence when first
the inquisitors had set up their tribunal there. They
reached Valencia safely, purchased there a yawl,
equipped it, and set sail. They were on the seas for
five days, when, of course, “it pleased God to send
a contrary wind, which blew them back into the port
from which they had set out”&mdash;and thus into the
hands of the benign inquisitors, so solicitous for the
salvation of their souls. They were arrested upon
landing, and brought to Toledo, whither the tribunal
had meanwhile been transferred. They were tried;
their flight confirmed their guilt; and so&mdash;<i>Christi
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>
nomine invocato</i>&mdash;they were burnt by order of the
inquisitors.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>As a result of the self-delations the first great
Auto de F&eacute; was held in Toledo on the first Sunday
in Lent (February 12), 1486. The reconciled of seven
parishes, numbering some 750 men and women, were
taken in procession and submitted to the penance
known as <i>verguenza</i>&mdash;or “shame”&mdash;which, however
humiliating to the Christian, was so hurtful to the
pride of the Jew (and no less to that of the Moor)
that he would almost have preferred death itself. It
consisted in being paraded through the streets, men
and women alike, bareheaded, barefooted, and naked
to the waist.</p>

<p>At the head of the procession, preceded by the
white cross, and walking two by two, went a section
of the Confraternity of St. Peter the Martyr&mdash;the
familiars of the Holy Office&mdash;dressed in black, with
the white cross of St. Dominic displayed upon their
cloaks. After them followed the horde of half-naked
penitents, cruel physical discomfort being added to
their mental torture, for the weather was so raw and
cold that it had been considered expedient to provide
them with sandals, lest they should have found it
impossible to walk.</p>

<p>In his hand each carried a candle of green wax&mdash;unlighted,
to signify that as yet the light of the Faith
did not illumine his soul. Anon, when they should
have been admitted to reconciliation and absolution,
these candles would be lighted, to signify that the light
of the Faith had once more entered their hearts&mdash;light
being the symbol of the Faith, just as “light”
and “faith” have become almost convertible terms.</p>

<p>Orozco informs us that among the penitents were
many of the principal citizens of Toledo, many persons
of eminence and honour, who must deeply have felt
their shame at being paraded in this fashion through
crowded streets, that they might afford a salutary
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>
spectacle to the multitude which had assembled in
Toledo from all the surrounding country districts. To
ensure this good attendance the Auto had been proclaimed
far and wide a fortnight before it was held.</p>

<p>The chronicler of these events tells us that many
and loud were the lamentations of these unfortunates.
But it is very plain that their condition did not move
his pity, for he expresses the opinion that their grief
was rather at the dishonour they were suffering than&mdash;as
it should have been&mdash;because they had offended
God.</p>

<p>The procession wound its way through the principal
streets of the city, and came at last to the Cathedral.
At the main doors stood two chaplains, who with
their thumbs made the sign of the cross on the brow
of each penitent in turn, accompanying the action by
the formula: “Receive the Sign of the Cross which
you denied, and which, being deluded, you lost.”</p>

<p>Within the Cathedral two large scaffolds had been
erected. The penitents were led to one of these, where
the reverend inquisitors waited to receive them. On
the other an altar had been raised, surmounted by the
green cross of the Inquisition, and as soon as all the
penitents were assembled, the crowd of holiday-makers
being closely packed about the scaffolds, Mass was
celebrated and a sermon of the Faith was preached.</p>

<p>This being at an end, the notary of the Holy
Office rose and called over the long roll of the
penitents, each answering to his name and hearing
his particular offence read out to him. Thereafter the
penance was announced. They were to be whipped
in procession on each of the following six Fridays,
being naked to the waist, bareheaded and barefooted;
they were to fast on each of those six Fridays, and
they were disqualified for the rest of their lives from
holding office, benefice, or honourable employment,
and from using gold, silver, precious stones, or fine
fabrics in their apparel.</p>

<p>They were warned that if they relapsed into error,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>
or failed to perform any part of the penance imposed,
they would be deemed impenitent heretics and abandoned
to the secular arm; and upon that grim warning
they were dismissed.</p>

<p>On each of the following six Fridays of Lent they
were taken in procession from the Church of San
Pedro Martir to a different shrine on each occasion,
and when at last they had completed this humiliating
penance it was further ordained that they should give
“alms” to the extent of one-fifth of the value of their
property, to be applied to the holy war against the
infidels of Granada.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Scarcely are the penitents of this Auto disposed of&mdash;the
last procession took place on March 23&mdash;than the
second Auto was held.</p>

<p>This occurred on the second Sunday in April, and
486 men and women were penanced on this occasion,
the procedure and the penance imposed being the
same.</p>

<p>At Whitsuntide of that year a sermon of the Faith
was preached by the inquisitor Costana, whereafter an
edict was publicly read and nailed to the Cathedral
door, summoning all who had fled to surrender themselves
to the Holy Office within ninety days, under
pain of being sentenced as contumaciously absent.
Among those cited there were, we learn, several
clerics, including three Jeronymite friars.</p>

<p>Finally, on the second Sunday in June&mdash;the 11th
of that month&mdash;we have the last Auto within the period
of grace. In this the penitents of four parishes,
numbering some 750 persons, were conducted to
reconciliation under precisely the same conditions as
had already been observed in the two previous Autos.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII<br />

<span class="medium">AUTOS DE F&Eacute;</span></h2>

<p>The Inquisition of Toledo had now to deal with
heretics who must be considered impenitent, since
they had not availed themselves of the benign leniency
of the Church and spontaneously sought the reconciliation
offered. From this moment the proceedings
assume a far more sinister character.</p>

<p>The first Auto under these altered conditions was
held on August 16, 1486. Among the accused
brought up for sentence were twenty men and five
women, whose offences doomed them to be abandoned
to the secular arm, and one of these was no less a
personage than the Regidor&mdash;or Governor&mdash;of Toledo,
a Knight-Commander of the Order of Santiago.</p>

<p>They were brought forth from the prison of the
Inquisition at a little before six o’clock on that summer
morning, arrayed in the yellow <i>sanbenito</i> and <i>coroza</i>.
Each <i>sanbenito</i> bore an inscription announcing the
name of the wearer and the nature of his offences
against the Faith, and they were smeared in addition
with grotesque red images of dragons and devils. A
rope was round the neck of each prisoner, and his
hands were pinioned with the other end of it. In
his hands, thus bound, he carried the unlighted candle
of green wax.</p>

<p>Thus they were led in procession through the
streets, the procession being headed as usual by a
posse of familiars of the Confraternity of St. Peter
the Martyr&mdash;the Soldiers of the Faith&mdash;and preceded
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>
now by the green cross of the Inquisition, which was
shrouded in a mourning veil of black crape.</p>

<p>The green cross did not merely symbolize, by its
colour, constancy and eternity, but it was fashioned
as if of freshly-cut boughs, to represent living wood,
the emblem of the true faith in contradistinction to the
withered branches that are to be flung into the fire.<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">140</a></p>

<p>Following the Soldiers of the Faith, under a
canopy of scarlet and gold, borne by four acolytes
and preceded by a bell-ringer, came the priest who
was to celebrate the Mass, in the crimson chasuble
prescribed by the liturgy for these dread solemnities.
He bore the Host, and as he advanced the multitude
sank down upon their knees, beating their breasts to
the clang of the bell.</p>

<p>Behind the canopy walked another posse of
familiars, and after these again followed the doomed
prisoners, each attended by two Dominican brothers
in their white cassocks and black cloaks, fervently
exhorting those who had not yet confessed to do so
even at this late hour.</p>

<p>The constables of the Holy Office and the men-at-arms
of the secular authorities flanked this section
of the procession, shouldering their glittering halberts.</p>

<p>They were closely followed by a group of men
who bore aloft, swinging from long green poles, the
effigies of those who were to be sentenced as contumaciously
absent&mdash;horribly grotesque mannequins
of straw with painted faces and bituminous eyes,
tricked out in the <i>sanbenitos</i> and <i>corozas</i> that should
have adorned the originals had not these remained
fortunately at large.</p>

<p>Next, mounted upon mules in trailing funereal
trappings, rode the reverend inquisitors, attended
by a group of mounted gentlemen in black, the white
cross upon their breasts announcing them as familiars
of the Holy Office, the officers of the tribunal.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span></p>

<p>They were immediately preceded by the banner
of the Inquisition, displaying in an oval medallion
upon a sable ground the green cross between an
olive-branch (dexter) and a naked sword (sinister).
The olive-branch, emblem of peace, symbolized the
readiness of the Inquisition to deal mercifully with
those who by true repentance and confession were
disposed to reconcile themselves with Holy Mother
Church. The mercy of which so much parade was
made might consist, as we know, of strangulation
before burning, or, at best, of perpetual imprisonment,
the confiscation of property, and infamy extending to
the children and grandchildren of the condemned.</p>

<p>The sword, on the other hand, announced the
alternative. Garcia Rodrigo says that it proclaimed
the Inquisition’s tardiness to smite. If so, it is a
curious symbol to have chosen for such a purpose;
but in any case the tardiness is hardly perceptible to
the lay vision.</p>

<p>The procession was closed by the secular justiciary
and his <i>alguaziles</i>.</p>

<p>In this order that grim cort&egrave;ge advanced to the
Cathedral Square. Here two great scaffolds were
draped in black for the ceremony&mdash;blasphemously
called an Act of Faith.</p>

<p>The prisoners were conducted to one of these
scaffolds and accommodated upon the benches that
rose from it in tiers, the highest being always reserved
for those who were to be abandoned to the secular
arm&mdash;to the end, we suppose, that they should be fully
in the view of the multitude below. Each of the
accused sat between two Dominican friars. The poles
bearing the effigies were placed so that they flanked
the benches.</p>

<p>On the other scaffold, on which an altar had been
raised and chairs set for the inquisitors, these now
made their appearance, accompanied by the notaries
and fiscal and attended by their familiars.</p>

<p>The shrouded green cross was placed upon the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>
altar, the tapers were lighted, the thurible kindled, and
as a cloud of incense ascended and spread its sweetly
pungent odour the Mass began.</p>

<p>At the conclusion a sermon of the Faith was
preached, wherein the sins of the accused were denounced,
and those who had incurred the penalty of
being abandoned to the secular arm were exhorted
fervently to repent and make their peace with Holy
Mother Church that they might save their souls from
the damnation into which, otherwise, it was the
Inquisition’s business to hurry them.</p>

<p>As the preacher ceased, the notaries of the Holy
Office of Toledo proceeded to the business of reading
out the crime of each accused, dwelling in detail upon
the particular form which his Judaizing was known to
have taken. As the name of each was called, he was
brought forward, and placed upon a stool,<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">141</a> whilst the
reading of the lengthy sentence took place.</p>

<p>It requires no great imaginative effort to form a
mental picture of these proceedings, and of the poor
livid wretch, horror-stricken and bathed in the sweat
of abject terror which that long-drawn agony must
have extorted from the stoutest, sitting there, perhaps
half-dazed already by the merciful hand of Nature, in
the glaring August sun, under the stare of a thousand
eyes, some pitiful, some hateful, some greedy of the
offered spectacle. Or it might be some poor half-swooning
woman, steadied by the attendant Dominicans,
who seek to support her fainting courage, to
mitigate her unutterable anguish with comfortless
words that hold out the promise of pitiless mercy.</p>

<p>And all this, <i>Christi nomine invocato!</i></p>

<p>The reading of the sentence is at an end. It concludes
with the formula that the Church, being unable
to do more for the offender, casts him out and abandons
him to the secular arm. Lastly comes the mockery
of that intercession, <i>efficaciter</i>&mdash;to preserve the inquisitors
from irregularity&mdash;that the secular justice shall
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>
so deal with him that his blood may not be shed, and
that he may suffer no hurt in life or limb.</p>

<p>Thereupon the doomed wretch is removed from
the scaffold; the <i>alguaziles</i> of the secular justiciary
seize him; the Regidor mutters a few brief words of
sentence, and he is thrust upon an ass and hurried
away, out of the city to the burning-place of La Dehesa.</p>

<p>A white cross has been raised in this field, where
twenty-five stakes are planted with the faggots piled
under each, and a mob of morbid sightseers surges,
impatient to have the spectacle begin.</p>

<p>The condemned is bound to the stake, and the
Dominicans still continue their exhortations. They
flaunt a crucifix before his dazed, staring eyes, and
they call upon him to repent, confess, and save his
soul from Eternal Hell. They do not leave him until
the fire is crackling and the first cruel little tongues of
bluish flame dart up through the faggots to lick the
soles of his naked feet.</p>

<p>If he has confessed, wrought upon by spiritual or
physical terror, the Dominican makes a sign, and the
executioner steps behind the stake and rapidly strangles
the doomed man. If his physical fears have not
sufficed to conquer his religious convictions, if he
remains firm in his purpose to die lingeringly, horribly,
a martyr for the faith that he believes to be the only
true one, the Dominican withdraws at last, baffled by
this “wicked stubbornness,” and the wretch is left to
endure the terrible agony of death by slow fire.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, under that limpid sky&mdash;<i>Christi nomine
invocato</i>&mdash;the ferocious work of the Faith goes on;
accused succeeds accused to hear his or her sentence
read, until the last of the twenty-five victims has been
surrendered to the tireless arm of the secular justice.
In the meadows of La Dehesa there is such a blaze of
the fires of the Faith, that it might almost seem that
the Christians have been avenging upon their enemies
those human torches which an enemy of Christianity is
alleged to have lighted once in Rome.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span></p>

<p>Six mortal hours, Orozco informs us, were consumed
in that ghastly business,<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">142</a> for the Court of the Holy
Office must in all things proceed with stately and
pompous leisureliness, with that calm equanimity
enjoined by the “Directorium”&mdash;<i>simpliciter et de plano</i>&mdash;lest
by haste it should fall into the unpardonable
offence of irregularity.</p>

<p>Not until noon did the proceedings conclude with
the hurrying away to La Dehesa of the last of those
twenty-five.</p>

<p>The inquisitors and their followers descended at
length from their scaffold, and withdrew to the Casa
Santa to rest them from these arduous labours of
propagating Christianity.</p>

<p>There was more to be done upon the morrow&mdash;very
important business, demanding an entirely different
ceremonial, wherefore it had been set apart and allotted
a day to itself.</p>

<p>The accused on this occasion were only two, but
they were two clerics. One was the parish priest of
Talavera; the other occupied the distinguished position
of a royal chaplain. Both had been found guilty of
Judaizing. They were conducted to the Auto in full
canonicals, as if about to celebrate Mass, each carrying
his veiled chalice. Led to the scaffold of the condemned,
they found themselves confronted from the
other scaffold not only by the inquisitors and their
attendants and familiars, but further by the Bishop, who
was attended by two Jeronymites&mdash;the Abbot of the
Convent of St. Bernard and the Prior of the Convent
of Sisla.</p>

<p>The notary of the Holy Office read out the crimes
of the accused, and pronounced them cast out from
the Church. Thereupon each was brought in turn
before the Bishop, who proceeded to degrade him,
since the law could not without sacrilege lay violent
hands upon an ecclesiastic.</p>

<p>Beginning by depriving each of his chalice, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>
Bishop passed on to divest the priestly offender of
his chasuble; stole, maniple, and alb were removed
in succession, the Bishop pronouncing the prescribed
formula for each stage of the degradation, and defacing
the tonsure by clipping away a portion of the surrounding
fringe of hair.</p>

<p>At last the doomed clerics stood stripped of all
insignia of their office. And now the <i>sanbenito</i>&mdash;that
chasuble of infamy&mdash;was flung upon the shoulders of
each; their heads were crowned with the tragically
grotesque <i>coroza</i>, a rope was put about each neck, and
their hands were pinioned. The sentence was fulfilled
at last by their being abandoned to the secular
authorities, who seized them and bore them away
to the stake.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On Sunday, October 16, a proclamation was read
in the Cathedral, pronouncing several deceased persons
to have been heretics, and setting forth that, although
dead themselves, their reputations lived as those of
Christians. Therefore it became necessary to publish
their heresy, and their heirs were summoned to appear
within twenty days and render to the inquisitors an
account of their inheritances, from the enjoyment of
which they were disqualified, since all property that
had belonged to the deceased was, by virtue of
Torquemada’s decree, confiscate to the royal treasury.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On December 10 900 persons were admitted to public
reconciliation. They were self-delators from remote
country districts who had responded to a recent edict
of grace published in those districts.</p>

<p>The notary announced the forms of Judaizing of
which each had been guilty and proclaimed it as their
intention henceforth to live and die in the faith of
Christ. He then read out the Articles of Faith, and
they were required to say “I believe” after each, and
lastly to make oath upon the Gospels and the crucifix
never again to fall into the error of Judaism, to denounce
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span>
any whom they knew to be Judaizers, and
ever to favour and uphold the Holy Inquisition and
the Holy Catholic faith.</p>

<p>The penance imposed was that they should be
scourged in procession for seven Fridays, and thereafter
on the first Friday of every month for a year.
This in their own districts. In addition, they were
required to come to Toledo and be scourged in procession
on the Feast of St. Mary of August and on
the Thursday of Holy Week. Two hundred of them
were further ordered to wear a <i>sanbenito</i> over their
ordinary garments for a year from that date, and never
to appear in public without it under pain of being
deemed impenitent and punished as relapsed.</p>

<p>Another 700 came to be reconciled on January 15,
1487, and yet another 1,200 on March 10. These
last, Orozco says, were from the districts of Talavera,
Madrid, and Guadalajara; and he adds that some
amongst them were penanced to the extent of being
condemned to wear the <i>sanbenito</i> for the remainder of
their lives.</p>

<p>In the Auto of May 7 fourteen men and nine women
were burnt. Amongst the former was a Canon of
Toledo who was accused of horrible heresies, and who,
writes Orozco, had confessed under torture to abominable
subversions of the words of the Mass. Instead of the
prescribed formula of the consecration, he had stated
that he was in the habit of uttering the absurd and
almost meaningless gibberish&mdash;“Sus Periquete, que
mira la gente.”</p>

<p>On the following day there was held a supplementary
Auto, especially for the purpose of dealing
with deceased and fugitive heretics, conducted with a
ceremony of an unusual and singularly theatrical order,
which is not so much typical&mdash;as are the other Autos
described&mdash;of what was taking place throughout Spain,
as indicative of a morbid inventiveness on the part of
the Toledan inquisitors.</p>

<p>On the scaffold usually occupied by the accused a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span>
sepulchral monument of wood had been erected and
draped in black. As each accused was cited by the
notary, the familiars opened the monument and drew
out the effigy of the dead man dressed in the grave-clothes
peculiar to the Jews.</p>

<p>To this dummy of straw the detailed account of his
crimes and the sentence of the court whereby he was
condemned as a heretic were solemnly read out. When
all the condemnations had thus been proclaimed, the
effigies were flung into a bonfire that had been kindled
in the square; and together with the effigies went the
bones of the deceased, which had been exhumed to
that end.</p>

<p>After that the next Auto of importance was held
on July 25, 1488, when twenty men and seventeen
women were sent to the stake, with a supplementary
Auto upon the morrow in which they burnt the effigies
of over a hundred dead and fugitive heretics.</p>

<p>And so it goes on, as recorded by the licentiate
Sebastian Orozco, and cited by Llorente<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">143</a> and Fidel
Fita.<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">144</a> From now onwards the burnings increase in
number. Indeed, all edicts of grace having expired,
and no new ones being permissible, sentencing to the
flames&mdash;through the medium of the secular arm&mdash;and
to perpetual imprisonment becomes the chief business
of the Inquisition in Toledo and elsewhere.</p>

<p>The <i>sanbenitos</i> of the burnt were preserved in the
churches of the parishes where they had lived. They
were hung in these churches as banners won in battle
are hung&mdash;trophies of victory over heresy.

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII<br />

<span class="medium">TORQUEMADA AND THE JEWS</span></h2>

<p>During that first year of the Inquisition’s establishment
in Toledo, twenty-seven persons there convicted
of Judaizing were burnt and 3,300 were penanced.
And what was taking place in Toledo was taking
place in every other important city in Spain.</p>

<p>Numerous now and vehement were the protests
against the terrible and excessive rigour of Torquemada.
Already, upon the death of Pope Sixtus IV,
a vigorous attempt had been made by some Spaniards
of eminence to procure the deposition of the Prior of
Holy Cross from the office of Grand Inquisitor. It
was argued that as his appointment had been made
by Sixtus, so it was automatically determined by that
Pope’s decease. But whatever hopes may have been
founded upon such an argument were very quickly
overthrown. Innocent VIII, as we have already seen,
not only confirmed Torquemada in his office, but considerably
increased his powers and the scope of his
jurisdiction.</p>

<p>Indeed, not only was he given jurisdiction over all
the Spains, but Innocent’s bull of April 3, 1487, <i>motu
proprio</i>, commanded all Catholic princes that, upon
being requested by the Grand Inquisitor so to do,
they should arrest any fugitives he might indicate and
send them captive to the Inquisition under pain of
excommunication.<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">145</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span></p>

<p>Notwithstanding the threat by which it was backed,
this command from the Vatican appears to have been
generally disregarded by the Governments of Europe.<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">146</a></p>

<p>That such a bull should have been solicited gives
us yet another glimpse of the terrible rancour against
the Jews which fanaticism had kindled in the soul of
Torquemada. Had his aim been merely, as expressed,
to weed the tares of heresy from the Catholic soil of
Spain, the self-imposed exile of those wretched fugitives
would fully have satisfied him, and he would not have
thought it necessary to hound them out of such shelter
as they had found abroad that he might have the
satisfaction of hurling them into the bonfire he had
kindled.</p>

<p>His position being so greatly strengthened by the
wider and ampler powers accorded to him by the new
Pontiff, Torquemada gave a still freer rein to the
terrible severity of his nature, and thus occasioned
those frequent and very urgent appeals to the
Vatican.</p>

<p>Many New-Christians who secretly practised Jewish
rites, being repelled from taking advantage of the edict
of grace by the necessity it imposed of undergoing the
horrible <i>verguenza</i> already described, applied now to
the Pontiff for secret absolution. This required special
briefs. Special briefs brought money into the papal
coffers, and procured converts to the Faith. Two
better reasons for granting these requests it would
have been impossible to have urged, and so the Curia
acceded.</p>

<p>But the result of this curial interference with the
autonomous jurisdiction of the Holy Office in Spain
was to provoke the resentment of Torquemada.
Wrangles ensued between the Grand Inquisitor and
the Pontifical Court&mdash;wrangles which may be likened
to those of two lawyers over a wealthy client.</p>

<p>Torquemada arrogantly demanded that this Roman
protection of heretics should not only cease in future
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span>
but be withdrawn where already it had been granted
in the past, and his demand had the full support of
Catholic Ferdinand, who did not at all relish the
spectacle of the gold of his subjects being poured into
any treasury other than his own. Rome, having meanwhile
pocketed the fees, was disposed to be amenable
to the representations of the Catholic Sovereigns and
their Grand Inquisitor; and the Pope proceeded
flagrantly to cancel the briefs of dispensation that had
been granted.</p>

<p>There was an outcry from the swindled victims.
They protested appealingly to the Pope that they had
confessed their sins against the Faith, and that absolution
had been granted them. Very rightly they urged
that this absolution could not now be rescinded&mdash;for
not even the Pope had power to do so much&mdash;and
they argued that, being in a state of grace, they could
not now be prosecuted for heresy.</p>

<p>But they overlooked the retrospective power which&mdash;however
unjustifiable by canon or any other law&mdash;the
Inquisition had arrogated to itself. By virtue of
this, as we have seen, the inquisitors could take proceedings
even against one who had died in a state of
grace, at peace with Holy Mother Church, if it were
shown that an offence of heresy committed at some
stage of his life had not been expiated in a manner
that the Holy Office accounted condign.</p>

<p>These protests of the unfortunate Judaizers, who
by their own action had achieved&mdash;as they now realized&mdash;no
more than self-betrayal, were met by the priestly
answer that their sins had been absolved in the tribunal
of conscience only, and that it still remained for them
to seek temporal absolution in the tribunal of the Holy
Office. This temporal absolution would accord them,
as we know&mdash;and as they knew&mdash;the right to live in
perpetual imprisonment after the confiscation of their
property and the destitution and infamy of their
children.</p>

<p>The answer, crafty and sophistical as it was, did
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span>
not suffice to silence the protests. Clamorously these
continued, and the Pope, unable to turn a deaf ear
upon them, fearful lest a scandal should ensue, effected
a sort of compromise. With the royal concurrence,
Innocent VIII issued several bulls, each commanding
the Catholic Sovereigns to admit fifty persons to secret
absolution with immunity from punishment. These
secret absolutions were purchased at a high price, and
they were granted upon the condition that in the event
of the re-Judaizing of a person so absolved, he would
be treated as relapsed, the secret absolution being then
published.</p>

<p>These absolutions were particularly useful in the
case of persons deceased, several of whom, at the petition
of the heirs, were included among the secretly
reconciled&mdash;the inheritance being thereby secured from
confiscation.</p>

<p>Altogether Pope Innocent granted four of these
bulls in 1486.<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">147</a> In the last one issued he left it at the
discretion of the Sovereigns to indicate those who
should be admitted to this grace, and they were permitted
to include the names even of persons against
whom proceedings had already been initiated.</p>

<p>With what degree of equanimity Torquemada
viewed these bulls of absolution we do not know. But
very soon we shall see him vexed by papal interference
of a fresh character.</p>

<p>Simoniacal practices were never more rampant in
Rome than under the rule of Innocent VIII. His
greed was notorious and scandalous, and a number of
alert baptized Jews bethought them that this might be
turned to account. They slyly submitted to the Holy
Father that although they were good Catholics, such
was the harshness of the Grand Inquisitor towards
men of their blood that they lived in constant dread
and anxiety lest the mere circumstance of their having
originally been Jews should be accounted a sufficient
reason to bring them under suspicion or should lay
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>
them open to the machinations of malevolent enemies.
Hence they implored his Holiness to grant them the
privilege of exclusion from inquisitorial jurisdiction.</p>

<p>At a price this immunity was to be obtained; and
soon others, seeing the success that had attended the
efforts of the originators of this crafty idea, were
following their example and setting a drag upon the
swift wheels of Torquemada’s justice.</p>

<p>That it stirred him to righteous anger is not to be
doubted, however subservient and injured the tone in
which he addressed his protest to the Pontiff.</p>

<p>Innocent replied by a brief of November 27, 1487,
that whenever the Grand Inquisitor found occasion to
proceed against one so privileged, he should inform
the Apostolic Court of all that might exist against the
accused, so that his Holiness should determine whether
the privilege was to be respected.<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">148</a></p>

<p>It follows inevitably that if there was heresy, or the
suspicion of it, the Pope must allow the justice of the
Holy Office to run its course. So that the Jews who
had purchased immunity must have realized that they
were dealing with one who understood the science of
economics (and the guile to be practised in it) even
better than did they, famous as they have always been
for clear-sightedness in such matters.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Meanwhile, with the power that was vested in him,
Torquemada was amassing great wealth from the proportion
of the confiscations that fell to his share. But
whatever his faults may have been, he was perfectly
consistent in them, just as he was perfectly, terribly
sincere.</p>

<p>Into the sin of pride he may have fallen. We see
signs of it. And, indeed, it is difficult to conceive of
a man climbing from the obscurity of the monastic cell
to the fierce glare of his despotic eminence and remaining
humble at heart. Humble he did remain; but
with that aggressive humility which is one of pride’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span>
worst forms and akin to self-righteousness&mdash;the sin
most dreaded by those who strive after sanctity.</p>

<p>We know that he unswervingly followed the stern
path of asceticism prescribed by the founder of his
order. He never ate meat; his bed was a plank; his
flesh never knew the contact of linen; his garments
were the white woollen habit and the black mantle of
the Dominican. Dignities he might have had, but he
disdained them. Paramo says<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">149</a> that Isabella sought
to force them upon him, and that, in particular, she
would have procured his appointment to the Archbishopric
of Seville when this was vacated by the
Cardinal of Spain. But he was content to remain the
Prior of Holy Cross of Segovia, as he had been when
he was haled from his convent to direct the affairs of
the Holy Office in Spain. The only outward pomp
he permitted himself was that whenever now he went
abroad he was attended by an escort of fifty mounted
familiars and two hundred men on foot. This escort
Llorente admits<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">150</a> was imposed by the Sovereigns. It
is possible, as is suggested, that it was to defend him
from his enemies, since the death of Arbu&eacute;s had
shown to what lengths the New-Christians were
prepared to go. But it is more probable that this
escort was accepted as an outward sign of the dignity
of his office, and perhaps also to serve the terrorizing
purpose which Torquemada considered so very
salutary.</p>

<p>That he practised the contempt for worldly riches
which he preached is beyond all doubt. We cannot
discover that any of the wealth that accrued to him
was put to any worldly uses or went in any way to
benefit any member of his family. Indeed, we have
already seen him refusing suitably to dower his sister,
allowing her no more than the pittance necessary to
enable her to enter a convent of the Tertiary Order
of St. Dominic.<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">151</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span></p>

<p>He employed the riches which his office brought
him entirely to the greater honour and glory of the
religion which he served with such terrible zeal. He
spent it lavishly upon such works as the rebuilding
of the Dominican Convent of Segovia, together with
the contiguous church and offices. He built the
principal church of his family’s native town of Torquemada
and half of the great bridge over the River
Pisuerga.<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">152</a></p>

<p>Fidel Fita quotes an interesting letter of Torquemada’s,
dated August 17, 1490, in which he
thanks the gentry of Torquemada for having sent
him a sumpter-mule, but rather seems to rebuke
the gift.</p>

<p>“To me,” he writes, “it was not, nor is necessary
to send such things; and it is certain that I should
have sent back the gift but that it might have
offended you; for I, praised be our Lord, possess
nine sumpter-mules, which suffice me.”<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">153</a></p>

<p>In sending the gift they had asked him for
assistance towards the work being carried out in the
church of Santa Ollala, the contribution he had
already made not having proved sufficient. He
replies regretting that he can do nothing at the
moment, as he is not with the Court, but promises
that upon his return thither he will do the necessary
with the Sovereigns so as to be able to send them the
further funds they require.<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">154</a></p>

<p>As early as 1482 he began to build at Avila the
church and monastery of St. Thomas. This pleasant
little country town, packed within its narrow red walls
and flanked with towers so that it presents the appearance
of a formidable castle, stands upon rising ground
in the fertile plain that is watered by the River Adaja.
Torquemada built his magnificent monastery beyond
the walls, upon the site of a humbler edifice that had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>
been erected by the pious D. Maria de Avila. It was
completed by the year 1493, and what moneys came
to him thereafter appear to have gone to the endowment
of this vast convent&mdash;a place of handsome,
spacious, cloistered courts and splendid galleries&mdash;which
became at once his chief residence, tribunal,
and prison.<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">155</a></p>

<p>Again his fanatical hatred of the Israelites displays
itself in the condition he laid down&mdash;and whose
endorsement he obtained from Pope Alexander VI&mdash;that
no descendant of Jew or Moor should ever be
admitted to these walls, upon which he engraved the
legend:</p>

<p class="center">PESTEM FUGAT H&AElig;RETICAM.<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">156</a></p>

<p>In this monastery the amplest provisions were
made, not only for the tribunal of the Inquisition, but
also for the incarceration of its prisoners.</p>

<p>Garcia Rodrigo, anxious to refute the widespread
belief that the prisons of the Inquisition were
unhealthy subterranean dungeons, draws attention to
the airy, sunny chambers here set apart for prisoners.<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">157</a>
It is true enough in this instance, as transpires from
certain records that are presently to be considered.<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">158</a>
But it is not true in general, and it almost seems a
little disingenuous of Garcia Rodrigo to put forward
a striking exception as an instance of the rule that
obtained.</p>

<p>Whatever the simplicity of Torquemada’s life, and
whatever his personal humility, it would be idle to
pretend that he was not imbued with the pride and
arrogance of his office, swollen by the increase of
power accorded him, until in matters of the Faith he
did not hesitate to dictate to the Sovereigns themselves,
and to reproach them almost to the point of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>
menace when they were slow to act as he dictated,
whilst it was dangerous for any under Sovereign
rank to come into conflict with the Grand Inquisitor.</p>

<p>As an instance of this, the case of the Captain-General
of Valencia may be cited. The Inquisition
of Valencia had arrested, upon a charge of hindering
the Holy Office, one Domingo de Santa Cruz, whose
particular offence, in the Captain-General’s view, came
rather within the jurisdiction of the military courts.
Acting upon this opinion, he ordered his troops to
take the accused from the prison of the Holy Office,
employing force to that end if necessary.</p>

<p>The inquisitors of Valencia complained of this
action to the Suprema, whereupon Torquemada imperiously
ordered the Captain-General to appear
before that council and render an account of what he
had done. He was supported in this by the King,
who wrote commanding the offender and all who had
aided him in procuring the release of Santa Cruz to
submit themselves to arrest by the officers of the
Inquisition.</p>

<p>Not daring to resist, that high dignitary was
compelled humbly to sue for absolution of the ecclesiastical
censure incurred, and he must have counted
himself fortunate that Torquemada did not subject
him to a public humiliation akin to that undergone by
the Infante of Navarre.</p>

<p>The brilliant and illustrious young Italian, Giovanni
Pico, Count of Mirandola, had a near escape of falling
into the hands of the dread inquisitor. When Pico
fled from Italy before the blaze of ecclesiastical wrath
which his writings had kindled, Pope Innocent issued a
bull, December 16, 1487, to Ferdinand and Isabella,
setting forth that he believed the Count of Mirandola
had gone to Spain with the intention of teaching in
the universities of that country the evil doctrines
which he had already published in Rome, notwithstanding
that, having been convinced of their error,
he had abjured them. (Another case of the “<i>e pur
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span>
si muove</i>” of Galileo.) And since Pico was noble,
gentle, and handsome, amiable and eloquent of speech
(<i>Pseudopropheta est; dulcia loquitur et ad modicum
placet</i>), there was great danger that an ear might be
lent to his teachings. Wherefore his Holiness begged
the Sovereigns that in the event of his suspicions
concerning Pico’s intentions being verified, their highnesses
should arrest the Count, to the end that the
fear of corporal pains might deter him where the fear
of spiritual ones had proved insufficient.</p>

<p>The Sovereigns delivered this bull to Torquemada
that he might act upon it. But Pico, getting wind of
the reception that awaited him, and having sufficient
knowledge of the Grand Inquisitor’s uncompromising
methods to be alarmed at the prospect, took refuge
in France, where he wrote the apologia of his
Catholicism, which he dedicated to Lorenzo de’
Medici.<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">159</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We have said, on the subject of the Inquisition’s
introduction into Spain, that to an extent and after a
manner this must be considered the most justifiable&mdash;by
which we are to be taken to mean the least unjustifiable&mdash;of
religious persecutions, inasmuch as it
had no concern save with deserters from the fold of
the Roman Church. Liberty was accorded to all
religions that were not looked upon as heretical&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>
that were not in themselves secessions from
Roman Catholicism&mdash;and Jew and Moslem had nothing
to fear from the Holy Office. It was only when, after
having received baptism, they reverted to their original
cults, that they rendered themselves liable to prosecution,
being then looked upon as heretics, or, more
properly speaking, as apostates.</p>

<p>But this point of view, which satisfied the Roman
See, did not at all satisfy the Prior of Holy Cross.
His bitter, fanatical hatred of the Israelites&mdash;almost
rivalling that of the Dean of Ecija in the fourteenth
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span>
century&mdash;urged him to violate this poor remnant of
equity, drove him to overstep the last boundary of
apparent justice, and carry the religious war into the
region of complete and terrible intolerance.</p>

<p>The reason he advanced was that as long as
the Jews remained undisturbed in the Peninsula, so
long would a united Christian Spain be impossible.
Despite penances, imprisonments, and burnings, the
Judaizing movement went on. New-Christians were
seduced back into the error of the Mosaic Law, whilst
conversion amongst the Jews was checked by respect
for the feelings of those who remained true to their
ancient faith. Nor did the Hebrew offences against
Christianity end there. There were the indignities
to which holy things were subjected at their hands.
There were criminal sacrileges in which&mdash;according
to Torquemada&mdash;they vented their hatred of the Holy
Christian Faith.</p>

<p>Such, for instance, was the outrage upon the
crucifix at Casar de Palomero in 1488.</p>

<p>On Holy Thursday of that year, in this village of
the diocese of Coria, several Jews, instead of being at
home with closed doors at such a season, as the
Christian law demanded, were making merry in an
orchard, to the great scandal of a man named Juan
Caletrido, who there detected them.</p>

<p>The spy, moved to horror at the mere thought of
these descendants of the crucifiers daring to be at play
upon such a day as that, went to inform several others
of what he had witnessed. A party of young Spaniards,
but too ready to combine the performance of a
meritorious act with the time-honoured sport of Jew-baiting,
invaded the privacy of the orchard, set upon
the Jews, and compelled them to withdraw into their
houses.</p>

<p>Smarting under this indignity&mdash;for, when all is said,
they had been more or less private in their orchard,
and they had intended no offence by their slight
evasion of the strict letter of the law&mdash;they related
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>
the event to other members of the synagogue, including
the Rabbi.</p>

<p>From what ensued it seems plain that they must
there and then have determined to avenge the honour
of their race, which they conceived had been affronted.</p>

<p>Llorente, basing himself upon the chronicler
Velasquez and the scurrilous anti-Jewish writings of
Torrejoncillo, supposes that their aim was to repeat
as nearly as possible the Passion of the Nazarene
upon one of His Images. That, indeed, may have been
the prejudiced view of the Grand Inquisitor.</p>

<p>But it is far more likely that, to spite these Christians
who had added this insult to the constant humiliations
they were putting upon the Israelites, the latter should
simply have resolved to smash one of the public symbols
of Christianity. The details of what took place
do not justify the supposition that their intentions went
any deeper.</p>

<p>On the morrow, which was Good Friday, the
circumstance of the day contributing perhaps to the
more popular version of the story, whilst the Christians
were in church for the service of the Passion, a party
of Jews repaired to an open space known as Puerto
del Gamo, where stood a large wooden crucifix. This
image they shattered and overthrew.</p>

<p>It is alleged that before finally breaking it they
had indulged in elaborate insult, “doing and saying
all that their rage dictated against the Nazarene.”</p>

<p>An Old-Christian, named Hernan Bravo, having
watched them, ran to bear the tale of their sacrilegious
deed. The Christians poured tumultuously out of
church, and fell upon the Jews. Three of the latter
were stoned to death on the spot; two others, one
of whom was a lad of thirteen, suffered each the loss
of his right hand; whilst the Rabbi Juan, being taken
as an inciter, was put to the question with a view
to inducing him to confess. But he denied so stoutly
the things he was required to admit, and the inquisitors
tortured so determinedly, that he died upon the rack&mdash;an
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span>
irregularity this for which each inquisitor responsible
would have to seek absolution at the hands
of the other.</p>

<p>All those who took part in the sacrilege suffered
confiscation of their property, whilst the pieces of the
crucifix, which had become peculiarly sanctified by
the affair, were gathered up and conveyed to the
Church of Casar, where, upon being repaired, the
image was given the place of honour.<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">160</a></p>

<p>It is extremely likely that the story of this outrage,
exaggerated as we have seen, would be one of the
arguments employed by Torquemada when first he
began to urge upon the attention of the Sovereigns
the desirability of the expulsion of the Jews. He
would cite it as a flagrant instance of the Jewish
hatred of Christianity, which gave rise to his complaint
and which he contended rendered a united
Spain impossible as long as this accursed race continued
to defile the land. Further, there can be
very little doubt that it would serve to revive and
to lend colour to the old stories of ritual murder
practised by the Jews and provided for by one of
the enactments in the “Partidas” code of Alfonso XI.</p>

<p>The reluctance of the Sovereigns to lend an ear
to any such arguments is abundantly apparent. Not
Ferdinand in all his bigotry could be blind to the fact
that the chief trades of the country were in the hands
of the Israelites, and to the inevitable loss to Spanish
commerce, then so flourishing, which must ensue on
their banishment. Of their ability in matters of finance
he had practical and beneficial experience, and the
admirable equipment of his army in the present campaign
against the Moors of Granada was entirely due
to the arrangements he had made with Jewish contractors.
Moreover, there was this war itself to engage
the attention of the Sovereigns, and so it was not
possible to lend at the moment more than an indifferent
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span>
attention to the fierce pleadings of the Grand
Inquisitor.</p>

<p>Suddenly, however, in 1490 an event came to light,
to throw into extraordinary prominence the practice of
ritual murder of which the Jews were suspected, and
to confirm and intensify the general belief in the stories
that were current upon that subject. This was the
crucifixion at La Guardia, in the province of La Mancha,
of a boy of four years of age, known to history as
“the Holy Child of La Guardia.”</p>

<p>A stronger argument than this afforded him for
the furtherance of his aims Torquemada could not
have desired. And it is probably this circumstance that
has led so many writers to advance the opinion that he
fabricated the whole story and engineered the substantiation
of a charge that so very opportunely placed
an added weapon in his hands.</p>

<p>Until some thirty years ago all our knowledge of
the affair was derived from the rather vague “Testimonio”
preserved in the sanctuary of the martyred
child, and a little history of the “Santo Ni&ntilde;o,” by
Martinez Moreno, published in Madrid in 1786. This
last&mdash;like Lope da Vega’s drama upon the same
subject&mdash;was based upon a “Memoria” prepared
by Damiano de Vegas of La Guardia in 1544, at a
time when people were still living who remembered
the incident, including the brother of a sacristan who
was implicated in the affair.<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">161</a></p>

<p>Martinez Moreno’s narrative is a queer jumble of
possible fact and obvious fiction, which in itself may
be responsible for the opinion that the whole story
was an invention of Torquemada’s to forward his own
designs.</p>

<p>But in 1887 the distinguished and painstaking
M. Fidel Fita published in the “Boletin de la Real
Academia de la Historia” the full record, which he
had unearthed, of the proceedings against Yuc&eacute; (or
Jos&eacute;) Franco, one of the incriminated Jews.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span></p>

<p>A good deal still remains unexplained, and must
so remain until the records of the trials of the other
accused are brought to light. It may perhaps be well
to suspend a final judgment until then. Meanwhile,
however, a survey of the discovered record should
incline us to the opinion that, if the story is an invention,
it is one for which those who were accused
of the crime are responsible&mdash;an unlikely contingency,
as we shall hope to show&mdash;and in no case can the
inventor have been Frey Tom&aacute;s de Torquemada.

<span class="medium">THE LEGEND OF THE SANTO NI&Ntilde;O</span></h2>

<p>The extravagant story related by Martinez Moreno,
the parish priest of La Guardia, in his little book on
the Santo Ni&ntilde;o, is derived, as we have said, partly
from the “Testimonio” and partly from the “Memoria”
by de Vegas; further, it embodies all those legendary,
supernatural details with which the popular imagination
had embellished the theme.</p>

<p>Either it is one of those deliberate frauds known
as “pious,” or else it is the production of an intensely
foolish mind. When we consider that the author was
a doctor of divinity and an inquisitor himself, we prefer
to incline to the former alternative.</p>

<p>This mixture of fact and fiction sets forth how a
party of Jews from the townships of Quintana, Tenbleque,
and La Guardia, having witnessed an Auto de
F&eacute; in Toledo, were so filled with rage and fury, not
only against the Holy Tribunal, but against all
Christians in general, that they conspired together
to encompass a complete annihilation of the Faithful.</p>

<p>Amongst them was one Benito Garcia, a wool-comber
of Las Mesuras, who was something of a
traveller, and who had learnt upon his travels of a
piece of sorcery attempted in France for the destruction
of the Christians, which had miscarried owing to
a deception practised upon the sorcerers.</p>

<p>The story is worth repeating for the sake of the
light it throws upon the credulity of the simple folk of
Spain in such matters, a credulity which in remote
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>
districts of the peninsula is almost as vigorous to-day
as it was in Moreno’s century.</p>

<p>The warlocks, in that earlier instance of which
Benito had knowledge, were alleged to be a party of
Jews who had fled from Spain on the first institution
of the Inquisition in Seville in 1482. They had
repaired to France bent upon the destruction of all
Christians, to the end that the Children of Israel
might become lords of the land, and that the Law
of Moses might prevail. For the sorcery to which
they proposed to resort they required a consecrated
wafer and the heart of a Christian child. These were
to be reduced to ashes to the accompaniment of certain
incantations, and scattered in the rivers of the country,
with the result that all Christians who drank the waters
must go mad and die.</p>

<p>Having obtained the wafer, they now approached
an impoverished Christian with a large family, and
tempted him with money to sell them the heart of one
of his numerous children. The Christian, of course,
repudiated the monstrous proposal. But his wife,
who combined cunning with cupidity, drove with the
Jews the bargain to which her husband refused to be
a party, and having killed a pig she sold them the
heart of the animal under obviously false pretences.</p>

<p>As a consequence, the enchantment which the
deluded Jews proceeded to carry out had no such
effect as was desired and expected.</p>

<p>Armed with his full knowledge of what had happened,
Benito now proposed to his friends that they
should have recourse to the same enchantment in
Spain, making sure, however, that the heart employed
was that of a Christian boy. He promised them that
by this means, not only the inquisitors, but all the
Christians would be destroyed, and the Israelites would
remain undisputed lords of Spain.</p>

<p class="caption">BANNER OF THE INQUISITION.<br />
From Limborch’s “Historia Inquisitionis.”</p>
</div>

<p>Amongst those who joined him in the plot was a
man named Juan Franco, of a family of carriers of
La Guardia. This man went with Benito to Toledo
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span>
on the Feast of the Assumption, intent upon finding a
child for their purpose. They drove there in a cart,
which they left outside the city while they went
separately about their quest.</p>

<p>Franco found what he sought in one of the doorways
of the Cathedral, known as the Puerta del Perdon&mdash;the
door, adds Moreno, through which the Virgin
entered the church when she came from heaven to
honour with the chasuble her votary St. Ildefonso.
The Jew beheld in this doorway a very beautiful child
of three or four years of age, the son of Alonso de
Pasamontes. His mother was near at hand, but she
was conveniently blind&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> conveniently for the
development of Moreno’s story, this blindness serving
not only the purpose of rendering the child’s undetected
abduction easily possible, but also that of
affording the martyred infant scope for the first
miraculous manifestation of his sanctity.</p>

<p>Juan Franco lured the boy away with the offer of
sweetmeats. He regained his cart with his victim,
concealed the latter therein, and so returned to
La Guardia. There he kept the child closely and
safely until Passion Week of the following year, or,
rather, until the season of the Passover, when the
eleven Jews&mdash;six of whom had received Christian
baptism&mdash;assembled in La Guardia. They took the
child by night to a cave in the hills above the river,
and there they compelled him to play the protagonist
part in a detailed parody of the Passion, scourging him,
crowning him with thorns, and finally nailing him to a
cross.</p>

<p>On the subject of the scourging, Moreno tells us
that the Jews carefully counted the number of lashes,
aiming in this, as in all other details, at the greatest
historical fidelity. But when the child had borne without
murmuring upwards of five thousand strokes, he
suddenly began to cry. One of the Jews&mdash;finding, we
are to suppose, that this weeping required explanation&mdash;asked
him: “Boy, why are you crying?”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span></p>

<p>To this the boy replied that he was crying because
he had received five lashes more than his Divine
Master.</p>

<p>“So that,” says this doctor of divinity quite soberly,
“if the lashes received by Christ numbered 5,495, as
computed by Lodulfo Cartujano in his ‘In Vita Christi,’
those received by the Holy Child Christoval were
5,500.”<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">162</a></p>

<p>He mentions here the child’s name as “Christoval,”
to which he informs us that it was changed from
“Juan,” to the end that the former might more aptly
express the manner of his death. There is no doubt
that some such consideration weighed when the child
was given that suggestive name; but the real reason
for it was that no name was known (for the identity of
the boy did not transpire), and it was necessary to
supply him with one by which he might be worshipped.</p>

<p>When he was crucified, his side was opened by one
of the Jews, who began to rummage<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">163</a> for the child’s
heart. He failed to find it, and he was suddenly
checked by the child’s question&mdash;“What do you seek,
Jew? If you seek my heart, you are in error to
seek it on that side; seek on the other, and you will
find it.”</p>

<p>In the very moment of his death, Moreno tells us,
the Santo Ni&ntilde;o performed his first miracle. His
mother, who had been blind from birth, received the
gift of sight in the instant that her child expired.<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">164</a></p>

<p>This interpolation appears to be entirely Moreno’s
own, and it is one of the justifications of our assumption
that the work is to be placed in the category of
pious frauds. But he is, of course, mistaken, by his
own narrative, in announcing this as the first of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span>
child’s miracles. He overlooks the miracle entailed
in the capacity to count displayed by a boy of four
years of age, and the further miracle of the speech
addressed by the crucified infant to the Jew who had
opened his side.</p>

<p>Benito Garcia was given the heart, together with
a consecrated wafer which had been stolen by the
sacristan of the Church of Sta. Maria de La Guardia,
and with these he departed to seek out the mage who
was to perform the enchantment. It happened, however,
that in passing through Astorga, Benito&mdash;who
was himself a <i>converso</i>&mdash;pretending that he was a
faithful Catholic, repaired to church, and, kneeling
there, the more thoroughly to perform this comedy of
devoutness, he pulled out a Prayer Book, between
the leaves of which the consecrated wafer had been
secreted.</p>

<p>A good Christian kneeling some little way behind
him was startled to see a resplendent effluence of light
from the book. Naturally he concluded that he was
in the presence of a miracle, and that this stranger
was some very holy man. Filled with reverent
interest, he followed the Jew to the inn where he
was lodged, and then went straight to the father
inquisitors to inform them of the portent he had
witnessed, that they might investigate it.</p>

<p>The inquisitors sent their familiars to find the man,
and at sight of them Benito fell into terror, “so that
his very face manifested how great was his crime.”
He was at once arrested, and taken before the
inquisitors for examination. There he immediately
confessed the whole affair.</p>

<p>Upon being desired to surrender the heart, he
produced the box in which it had been placed, but
upon opening the cloth that had been wrapped round
it, the heart was discovered to have miraculously
vanished.</p>

<p>Yet another miracle mentioned by Moreno is that
when the inquisitors opened the grave where it was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span>
said that the infant had been buried, they found the
place empty, and the Doctor considers that since the
child had suffered all the bitterness of the Saviour’s
Passion, it was God’s will that he should also know
the glories of the Resurrection, and that his body had
been assoomed into heaven.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The “Testimonio” from the archives of the
parochial church of La Guardia, printed on tablets
preserved in the Sanctuary of the Santo Ni&ntilde;o, is
quoted by Moreno,<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">165</a> and runs as follows:</p>

<p>“We, Pedro de Tapia, Alonso Doriga and Matheo
Vazquez, secretaries of the Council of the Holy and
General Inquisition, witness to all who may see this
that by certain proceedings taken by the Holy Office
in the year 1491, the Most Reverend Frey Tom&aacute;s de
Torquemada being Inquisitor-General in the Kingdoms
of Spain, and the inquisitors and judges by him deputed
in the City of Avila being the Very Reverend
Dr. D. Pedro de Villada, Abbot of San Marcial and
San Millan in the Churches of Leon and Burgos, the
Licentiate Juan Lopez de Cigales, Canon of the
Church of Cuenca, and Frey Fernando de Santo
Domingo of the Order of Preachers, inquisitors as is
said against heretical pravity, and with power and
special commission from the Very Reverend D. Pedro
Gonzalez de Mendoza, Cardinal of Santa Cruz, Archbishop
of Toledo, Primate of Spain, Grand Chancellor
of Castile, and Bishop of Siguenza.</p>

<p>“It transpires that the said inquisitors proceeding
against certain Jews and some New-Christians converted
from Jews, of the neighbourhood of La Guardia,
Quintanar, and Tenbleque, ascertained that amongst
other crimes by these committed was that: one of the
said Jews and one of the newly-converted being in
Toledo and witnessing a burning that was being done
by the Holy Office in that city, they were cast down
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span>
by this execution of justice. The Jew said to the
convert that he feared the great harm that might
come and did come to them from the Holy Inquisition,
and having treated of various matters germane to this
subject, the Jew said that if they could obtain the
heart of a Christian boy all could be remedied. And
so, after his wide practice in this matter, the Jew from
the neighbourhood of Quintanar undertook to procure
a Christian boy for the said purpose.</p>

<p>“And it was agreed that the said New-Christian
should go to Quintanar as soon as bidden by the Jew;
and upon this understanding each of the aforesaid left
the City of Toledo and returned to his own district.</p>

<p>“A few days later the said Jew summoned the
New-Christian to come to him in the village of
Tenbleque, where he awaited him in his father’s
house. There they foregathered, and agreed upon a
day when they should meet at Quintanar, whither the
New-Christian now returned, and informed, as he had
agreed, a brother of his own, who like himself was
also a New-Christian, and he related fully all that had
been arranged, his brother being of the same mind.</p>

<p>“The better to execute their accursed project,
they arranged a place to which the child should be
brought, and what was to be done&mdash;that this should
be in a cave near La Guardia, on the road to Oca&ntilde;a,
on the right-hand side. And thus to execute the
matter, the said New-Christian went to Quintanar on
the day arranged together with the said Jew.</p>

<p>“The better to dissemble, he went to a tavern,
where presently he was able to communicate with the
Jew, and as a result of what passed between them,
the New-Christian went out to await him on the road
to Villa Palomas in a ravine, where presently he was
joined by the said Jew on an ass with the child before
him&mdash;of the age of three or four years.</p>

<p>“They went on together, and arrived after nightfall
at the said cave, whither came, as was arranged,
the brother of the New-Christian, and with him other
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span>
newly-converted Jews, with whom it appears that the
aforesaid matter had been treated.</p>

<p>“Being all assembled in the cave, they lighted a
candle of yellow wax, and so that the light should not
be seen they hung a cloak over the mouth of the cave.
They seized the boy, whom the said Jew had taken
from the Puerta del Perdon in Toledo&mdash;which boy
was named Juan, son of Alonso Pasamontes and of
Juana La Guindera. The said New-Christians now
made a cross out of the timbers of a ladder which had
been brought from a mill. They threw a rope round
the boy’s neck and they set him on the cross, and with
another rope they tied his legs and arms, and they
nailed his feet and hands to the cross with nails.</p>

<p>“Being thus placed (<i>puesto</i>), one of the New-Christians
from the neighbourhood of La Guardia
bled the child, opening the veins of his arms with a
knife, and he caught the blood that flowed in a cauldron;
and with a rope in which they had tied knots some
whipped him, whilst others set a crown of thorns upon
his head. They struck him, spat upon him, and used
opprobrious words to him, pretending that what they
were saying to the said child was addressed to the
Person of Christ. And whilst they whipped him, they
said: ‘<i>Betrayer, trickster, who, when you preached,
preached falsehood against the Law of God and Moses;
now you shall pay here for what you said then. You
thought to destroy us and to exalt yourself. But we
shall destroy you.</i>’ And further: ‘<i>Crucify this betrayer
who once announced himself King, who was to
destroy our temple</i>....’ etc. etc.<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">166</a></p>

<p>“After the ill-treatment and vituperation, one of
the New-Christians from La Guardia opened the left
side of the child with a knife and drew out his heart,
upon which he threw some salt; and so the child
expired upon the cross. All of which was done in
mockery of the Passion of Christ; and some of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span>
New-Christians took the body of the child and buried
it in a vineyard near Sta. Maria de Pera.</p>

<p>“A few days later the said Jew and New-Christians
met again in the cave and attempted
certain enchantments and conjurations with the heart
of the child and a consecrated Host obtained through
a sacristan who was a New-Christian. This conjuration
and experiment they performed with the
intention that the inquisitors of heretical pravity and
all other Christians should enrage and die raging
(<i>rabiendo</i>), and the Law of Jesus Christ our Redeemer
should be entirely destroyed and superseded by the
Law of Moses.</p>

<p>“When they saw that the said experiment did not
operate nor had the result they hoped, they assembled
again elsewhere, and having treated of all that they
desired to effect, by common consent one of them was
sent with the heart of the said child and the consecrated
Host to the Aljama of Zamora, which they accounted
the principal Aljama in Castile, to the end that certain
Jews there, known to be wise men, should with the
said heart and Host perform the said experiment and
sorcery that the Christians might enrage and die,
and thus accomplish what they so ardently desired.</p>

<p>“And for the greater ascertaining of the crime and
demonstration of the truth, the said inquisitors having
arrested some of the said offenders, New-Christians
and Jews, they set the accused face to face, so that
in the confession of their crimes there was conformity,
and these confessions consisted of what has
been here set down. In addition other further steps
were taken to verify the places where the crimes were
committed and the place where the child was buried;
and they took one of the principal accused to the
place where the child was buried, and there they
found signs and demonstration of the truth of all.<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">167</a>
Some of the said accused, and some already deceased,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span>
being prosecuted, they were sentenced and abandoned
to the secular arm, all that we have set down being
in accordance with the records of the proceedings to
which we refer.</p>

<p>“The said ‘Testimonio’ written upon three sheets
bearing our rubrics, we the said secretaries deliver by
request of the Procurator-General of the village of
La Guardia, by order of the Very Illustrious Se&ntilde;ores
of His Majesty’s Council of the Holy Inquisition in
the City of Madrid in the Diocese of Toledo, on the
19th day of September of the year of the birth of our
Lord Jesus Christ, 1569.</p>

<p>This “Testimonio” does not afford us the name
of any one of the offenders&mdash;presumably that the holy
place in which the tablets were exposed should not
be desecrated. When it is compared with the account
left by Moreno and the discrepancies between the two
become apparent, when, further, the extravagances of
Moreno’s story are considered, it is not surprising that
the conclusion should have been reached that the
whole affair was trumped up to forward that campaign
against the Jews to which Torquemada was employing
his enormous energies.</p>

<p>But the records of the trial of Yuc&eacute; Franco discovered
by Fidel Fita throw a very different light
upon the matter. And whilst we know that Torquemada
did avail himself to the utmost of this affair of
the Santo Ni&ntilde;o to encompass the banishment of the
Jews from Spain, we must consider all notion that
he himself simply invented the story to that end as
completely dispelled by the evidence that is now
to be examined.</p>

<p>From the records of the trial of Yuc&eacute; Franco
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span>
we are to-day not only able very largely to reconstruct
the event, but also to present a complete
instance of the application of the jurisprudence of
the Inquisition. Indeed, had the archives of the
Holy Office been ransacked for an entirely typical
prosecution, embodying all the features peculiar to
that terrible court, no better instance than this could
have been forthcoming.

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX<br />

<span class="medium">THE ARREST OF YUC&Eacute; FRANCO</span></h2>

<p>In May or June of 1490&mdash;the time of year being
approximately determined by the events that follow&mdash;a
baptized Jew of Las Mesuras named Benito Garcia
put up at an inn in the northern village of Astorga.
He was an elderly man of some sixty years of age, a
wool-comber by trade and a considerable traveller in
the course of his trading.</p>

<p>In the common-room of the tavern where he sat
at table were several men of Astorga, who, either in a
drunken frolic or because they were thieves, went
through the contents of his knapsack, and discovered
in it some herbs and a communion wafer, which they
at once assumed to be consecrated (and which it was
grossest sacrilege for a layman so much as to touch).</p>

<p>Uproar followed the announcement of the discovery.
With cries of “Sacrilege!” these thieving
drunkards fell upon the Jew. They beat him. They
flung a rope about his neck, dragged him from the
inn and haled him into the presence of the Provisor
of Astorga, Dr. Pedro de Villada. The reverend
doctor discharged there the functions of an agent of
the Holy Office. He was fully experienced in inquisitorial
affairs, and he was upon the eve of being
promoted to the dignity of inquisitor in the court of
Avila.</p>

<p>Villada received the wafer, heard the accusation,
and took a short way with Benito when the latter
refused to explain himself. He ordered him two
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span>
hundred lashes, and finding the man still obdurate
after this punishment, he submitted him to the water-torture.
Under this the wretched fellow at last
betrayed himself. Of precisely what he said we have
no record taken at the time; but we have his own
word for it&mdash;as reported afterwards by Yuc&eacute; Franco
to whom he uttered it&mdash;that “he had said more than
he knew, and enough to burn him.”<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">168</a></p>

<p>Having, as is clear, obtained from him an
admission of his own guilt, Villada now proceeded,
as prescribed by the “Directorium,” to induce him to
incriminate others. We know the methods usually
employed; from these and from what follows it is
quite reasonable to assume that recourse was had to
them now.</p>

<p>Following Eymeric’s instructions, Villada would,
no doubt, admonish him with extreme kindness,
professing to cast no blame upon Benito himself but
rather upon those evil ones who had seduced him into
error, and he would exhort the prisoner to save
himself by showing a true penitence, pointing out that
the only proof of his penitence he could advance would
be a frank and free delation of those who had led him
so grievously astray.</p>

<p>From the occasional glimpses of this Benito Garcia
vouchsafed us in the records of the trial of Yuc&eacute;
Franco, we perceive a rather reckless personality,
of a certain grim, sardonic humour, gleams of which
actually pierce through the dehumanization of the legal
documents to ensnare our sympathy.</p>

<p>He is imbued with contempt for these Christians
whose religion he embraced forty years ago, in what
he accounts a weak moment of his youth, and from
which he secretly seceded again some five years before
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span>
his arrest. He is weighed down by remorse for
having been false to the Jewish faith in which he was
born; he believes himself overtaken by the curse
which his father launched upon him when he took
that apostatizing step; he is out of all conceit with
Christianity; since seeing the bonfires of the Faith he
has come to the conclusion that as a religion it is an
utter failure; it has been his habit to sneer at Jews
who were inclining to Christianity.</p>

<p>“Get yourselves baptized,” was the gibe he
flung at them, “and go and see how they burn the
New-Christians.”<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">169</a></p>

<p>In the prison of Avila&mdash;when he gets there&mdash;his
one professed aim is to die in the faith of his fathers.</p>

<p>But it would seem that when first taken in the
toils of the Inquisition, and having experienced in his
own person the horrors of its methods, he realizes
the sweetness of life, and eagerly avails himself of the
false loophole so alluringly exposed by the reverend
doctor.</p>

<p>In his examination of June 6 he betrays to
Villada the course of his re-Judaizing. He relates
that five years ago, whilst in talk with one Juan de
Oca&ntilde;a, a converso whom he believes to be a Jew at
heart under an exterior of Christianity, the latter had
urged him to return to the Jewish faith, saying that
Christ and the Virgin were myths, and that there is
no true law but that of Moses. Lending an ear to
these persuasions, Benito had done many Jewish
things, such as not going to church (although he
whipped his children when they stayed away, lest
their absence should betray his own apostasy) nor
observing holy-days, eating meat on Fridays and
fast-days at the house of Mos&eacute; Franco and Yuc&eacute;
Franco&mdash;Jews of the neighbourhood of Tenbleque&mdash;and
wherever else he could eat it without being
detected. Indeed, for the past five years, he admits,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span>
he has been a Jew at heart, and if during that time
he did not more completely observe Jewish rites and
practices, it was because he dared not for fear of
being discovered; whilst all the Christian acts he had
performed had been merely a simulation, that he might
appear to be a Christian still. The confessions he
had made to the priest of La Guardia had been false
ones, and he had never gone to Communion&mdash;“believing
that the Corpus Christi was all a farce
(<i>creyendo que todo era burla el Corpus Christi</i>).” He
even added that whenever he saw the Viaticum carried
through the streets, it was his habit to spit and to
make <i>higas</i> (a gesture of contempt).<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">170</a></p>

<p>In these last particulars his confession is of an
extreme frankness, and we can only suppose that he
is merely repeating what the torture had already
extracted from him. Completely to elucidate the
matter as it concerns Benito Garcia, we should require
to be in possession of the full records of his own trial
(which have not yet been discovered), whereas at
present we have to depend upon odd documents from
that <i>dossier</i> which are introduced in Yuc&eacute; Franco’s as
relating to the latter.</p>

<p>Questioned more closely concerning these Jews he
has mentioned&mdash;Mos&eacute; and Yuc&eacute; Franco&mdash;Benito states
that they lived with their father, &Ccedil;a Franco, at Tenbleque,
that he was in the habit of visiting them upon
matters of business, and that he had frequently eaten
meat at their house on Fridays and Saturdays and
other forbidden days, and had often given them money
to purchase oil for the synagogue lamps.</p>

<p>We know that, as a consequence of these confessions,
&Ccedil;a Franco, an old man of eighty years of age, and his
son Yuc&eacute;, a lad of twenty who was a cobbler by
trade, were arrested on July 1, 1489, for proselytizing
practices&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> for having induced Benito Garcia to
abandon the Christian faith to which he had been
converted.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span></p>

<p>&Ccedil;a’s other son, Mos&eacute;, was either dead at the time
or else he died very shortly after arrest and before
being brought to trial.</p>

<p>Juan de Oca&ntilde;a, too, was arrested upon the same
grounds.</p>

<p>They were taken to Segovia, and thrown into the
prison of the Holy Office in that city. In this prison
Yuc&eacute; Franco fell so seriously ill that he believed himself
at the point of death.</p>

<p>A physician named Antonio de Avila, who spoke
either Hebrew or the jargon of Hebrew and Romance
that was current among the Jews of the Peninsula,
went to attend to the sick youth. Yuc&eacute; implored this
doctor to beseech the inquisitors to send a Jew to
pray with him and to prepare him for death&mdash;“<i>que
le dixiese las cosas que disen los Judios quando se
quieren morir</i>.”</p>

<p>The physician, who, like all the family of the
Inquisition, was himself a spy, duly conveyed the
request to the inquisitors. They seized the chance to
put into practice one of the instructions advanced by
Eymeric. They sent a Dominican, one Frey Alonso
Enriquez, disguised as a Jew, to minister to the
supposed moribund. The friar had a fluent command
of the language spoken by the Jews of Spain. He
introduced himself to the lad as a Rabbi named
Abraham, and completely imposed upon him and won
his confidence.</p>

<p>He pressed Yuc&eacute; to confide in him, and in his
manner of doing so he proceeded along the crafty lines
advocated by the “Directorium.”</p>

<p>Eymeric, as will be remembered, enjoins that when
a prisoner is examined, the precise accusation against
him should not be disclosed; rather he should be
questioned as to why he conceives that he has been
arrested and by whom he supposes himself to have
been accused, with the object of perhaps discovering
further and hitherto unsuspected matters against him.</p>

<p>Against Yuc&eacute; Franco and the other prisoners there
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span>
was at this stage no charge beyond that&mdash;serious
enough in itself&mdash;of having induced Benito Garcia to
re-Judaize. But the disguised friar now pressed him
with probing questions, asking him what he had done
to get himself arrested.</p>

<p>Yuc&eacute;&mdash;who did not yet know what was the charge&mdash;entirely
duped, and believing that his visitor was a
Rabbi of his own faith, replied that “<i>he had been
arrested on account of the</i> mita <i>of a</i> nahar, <i>which had
been after the manner of</i> Otohays.”<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">171</a></p>

<p>We have left the Hebrew words untranslated to illustrate
the unintelligibility of the phrase to the general.</p>

<p><i>Mita</i> means “killing,” <i>nahar</i> means “a boy,”
whilst <i>Otohays</i>&mdash;literally “that man”&mdash;is startling
because it is identical with the term used in St. Luke
(xxiii. 4) and in the Acts of the Apostles (v. 28) to
designate Christ.</p>

<p>Yuc&eacute; begged the false Rabbi Abraham to go to
the Chief Rabbi of the Synagogue of Segovia,<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">172</a> a man
of very considerable importance and influence, and to
inform him of this fact, but otherwise to keep the
matter very secret.</p>

<p>The Dominican repaired to the inquisitors who
had sent him with this very startling piece of information,
which was corroborated by the physician, who had
remained well within earshot during the entire interview.</p>

<p>By order of the inquisitors Frey Alfonso Enriquez
returned to Yuc&eacute;’s prison a few days later to attempt
to elicit from the young Jew further particulars of the
matter to which he had alluded. But the lad&mdash;probably
considerably recovered by now, and therefore
more alert&mdash;evinced the greatest mistrust of the
physician Avila, who was hovering near them, and
would not utter another word on the subject.<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">173</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span></p>

<p>The matter was of such gravity that we are quite
safe in assuming&mdash;and we have evidence to warrant
the assumption&mdash;that it was instantly communicated
to Torquemada, who at the time was at his convent of
Segovia, practically upon the spot.</p>

<p>We know&mdash;as will presently transpire&mdash;that it was
by order of Torquemada that Yuc&eacute; Franco and the
others came to be in the prison of the Holy Office at
Segovia, instead of in that of the extremely active
Inquisition of Toledo, within whose jurisdiction the
accused dwelt and the crime had been committed.
We are unable to give an absolutely authentic reason
for this. But we gather that the examination of
&Ccedil;a Franco, or of Oca&ntilde;a, or perhaps of Benito himself&mdash;who
had said “more than he knew”&mdash;must have
yielded disclosures of such a nature that upon learning
them the Grand Inquisitor had desired that the trial
should be conducted immediately under his own
direction.</p>

<p>The Sovereigns, who had been in Andalusia since
May of the previous year, about the war upon Granada,
now wrote to Torquemada&mdash;in July 1490&mdash;bidding
him join them there.</p>

<p>From Segovia the Grand Inquisitor replied, urging
very pressing business to which he proposed to give
his personal attention, wherefore he begged them
to permit him to postpone his response to their
summons.<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">174</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>He quitted Segovia at about this time to repair to
Avila, where the work upon the church and monastery
of St. Thomas was well advanced; so well advanced,
indeed, that already he was able to take up his residence
in the monastery.</p>

<p>We may assume that the pressing business he had
urged to the Sovereigns as an excuse for postponing
his journey into Andalusia was the business of inquiring
into the alleged crimes of these Hebrew prisoners.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span>
For we know that he had intended having them
brought before himself at Avila, but that being unable
to dispose of the matter before the end of August or
to postpone beyond that time his departure to rejoin
the Court, he was compelled to entrust the matter to
his delegates&mdash;the Dominican Frey Fernando de
Santo Domingo, and the sometime Provisor of Astorga,
Dr. Pedro de Villada, with whom, no doubt, he would
leave&mdash;as he says himself&mdash;the fullest instructions.</p>

<p>So much we are justified in assuming from the
tenor of the following letter, which he delivered to
them under date of August 27, to serve them as their
warrant to remove the prisoners from Segovia and
bring them to Avila for trial.</p>

<p>He wrote as follows:</p>

<p>“We, Frey Tom&aacute;s de Torquemada, Prior of the
Monastery of Holy Cross of Segovia, of the Order
of Preachers, Confessor and Councillor to the King
and Queen, our Sovereign lords, Inquisitor-General
of heretical pravity and apostasy in the Kingdoms of
Castile and Aragon and all other Dominions of their
Highnesses, so deputed by the Holy Apostolic See,</p>

<p>Make known to you,</p>

<p>Reverend and Devout Fathers, D. Pedro de Villada,
Doctor of Canon Law ... Juan Lopes de Cigales,
Licentiate of Holy Theology ... and to you, Frey
Fernando de Santo Domingo ... Inquisitors of
heretical pravity in the said City and Bishopric of
Avila,</p>

<p>That we, by certain and legitimate
information received, ordered the arrest of the persons
and bodies of Alonso Franco, Lope Franco, Garcia
Franco, and Juan Franco of the neighbourhood of
La Guardia in the Archbishopric of Toledo, and of
Yuc&eacute; Franco, a Jew of the neighbourhood of Tenbleque,
and of Mos&eacute; Abenamias, a Jew of the City of Zamora,
and of Juan de Oca&ntilde;a and Benito Garcia, of the neighbourhood
of the said place of La Guardia, and the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span>
sequestration of all their property for having practised
heresy and apostasy and for having perpetrated certain
deeds, crimes, and offences against our Holy Catholic
Faith, and we ordered them to be taken to and
held in the prison of the Holy Inquisition of the
City of Segovia until their cases should be fully
known to and decided by us or by such person or
persons to whom we consign them upon being so
acquainted.</p>

<p>“But inasmuch as we are now occupied with other
and arduous matters, and therefore may not personally
acquaint ourselves with the said cases or with any one
of them, trusting in the legality, learning, experience,
and sound conscience of you, the said Reverend Father
Inquisitors and of each of you, and that you are such
persons as will well and faithfully discharge what we
entrust to you by these presents we commit to you,
the said Reverend Father Inquisitors, and to each of
you, <i>in solidum</i>, the said proceedings against and trials
of the aforementioned and of any of them, whether
they may have been participators or accessories before
or after the fact of the said crimes and offences in any
way committed against our Holy Catholic Faith, and
likewise of the abettors, counsellors, defenders, concealers,
those who had knowledge of the facts and
offenders of whatsoever degree, to the end that concerning
them you may receive and obtain any information
from any part of the said Kingdoms, and seize
and examine any witness, and inquire, learn, proceed,
imprison, sentence, and abandon to the secular arm
such as you may find guilty, absolve and liberate
those without guilt, and do concerning them all things
and any thing that we ourselves should do being
present....</p>

<p>“And by these presents we order the Father
Inquisitors of the City of Segovia and each and any
of them in whose power are the said prisoners to
deliver them immediately in safe custody to you.</p>

<p>“Given in the Monastery of St. Thomas of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span>
said Order of Preachers, which is beyond and near the
walls of the said City of Avila.”<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">175</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At what stage of the affair the four brothers Franco
of La Guardia&mdash;Alonso, Lope, Garcia, and Juan&mdash;had
been arrested, and upon whose information, we do not
know. But we do know&mdash;for the <i>dossier</i> of Yuc&eacute;’s
trial is complete&mdash;that they were not betrayed by
Yuc&eacute;.</p>

<p>That their names had been divulged is a confirmation
of the surmise that the examinations of Oca&ntilde;a,
or &Ccedil;a Franco, or even Benito Garcia, had already
yielded further information on the subject of the affair
of La Guardia.</p>

<p>It must be understood that the record of any
examination of these prisoners in which the name of
Yuc&eacute; Franco was not mentioned would find no place
in the <i>dossier</i> of the latter’s trial.</p>

<p>The four Francos of La Guardia were brothers, as
we have said; but they were nowise related to the
Francos of Tenbleque&mdash;&Ccedil;a and Yuc&eacute;. They were
dealers in cereals&mdash;possibly millers&mdash;as we shall see,
and they owned a number of carts which they appear
to have further employed in a carrier’s business.
They were baptized Jews, as is already made clear
in Torquemada’s letter by the fact that he does not
describe them&mdash;as he does the others&mdash;as Jews.</p>

<p>All concerned in the affair, with the exception of
one Ribera, who does not at present enter into consideration,
were men drawn from a humble class of
life&mdash;a class which through ignorance has always been
credulous and prone to belief in sorcery and enchantments.</p>

<p>A curious circumstance is the omission in Torquemada’s
letter of all mention of the octogenarian &Ccedil;a
Franco, whom we know to have been already under
arrest.</p>

<p>Having thus entrusted the conduct of the affair to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span>
his subordinates, the Grand Inquisitor set out to join
the Sovereigns in Andalusia.</p>

<p>The prisoners were soon afterwards brought to
Avila, secrecy being so well observed that each remained
in ignorance of the arrest of the others. But
before being transferred from Segovia Yuc&eacute; was taken
before the Holy Office there for examination on
October 27 and 28. And from the nature of the
questions&mdash;as revealed by the depositions made&mdash;we
are left to assume that the inquisitors aimed at further
incriminating the Francos of La Guardia, proceeding
upon information extracted from them, or else obtained
from one of the other prisoners.</p>

<p>In answer to the questions set him, Yuc&eacute; Franco
deponed that some three years earlier he had gone to
La Guardia to buy wheat for the unleavened bread of
the Passover from Alonso Franco, having been told
that the latter had wheat of good quality for sale. He
sought Alonso in the market, and thence accompanied
him to his house. Talking as they went, Alonso
asked him why they made this unleavened bread, to
which Yuc&eacute; replied that it was to commemorate God’s
deliverance of the Children of Israel out of Egypt.</p>

<p>The question may certainly seem an odd one from
a man who had been born a Jew. But it should be
remembered that ignorance and lack of education
might easily account for it.</p>

<p>Yuc&eacute; further deponed that in the pursuit of this
conversation Alonso not only betrayed nostalgic leanings
towards his original faith, but actually admitted
that together with some of his brothers he had crucified
a boy one Good Friday in the manner that the Jews
had crucified Christ.</p>

<p>Continuing, he said that Alonso had asked him
whether the Paschal lamb eaten by the Jews at the
time of leaving Egypt had been <i>terefa</i> (slaughtered
and bled in the Jewish manner), to which Yuc&eacute; had
replied that it had not, as at that time the Law had not
yet been made.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span></p>

<p>These replies were construed by the inquisitors
into admissions of proselytizing on the part of Yuc&eacute;,
and when subsequently at Avila (January 10, 1491)
he was reminded of what he had said at Segovia concerning
what had passed between Alonso Franco and
himself, and asked whether he could remember anything
further, he confirmed all that he had already deponed,
but could only add a question on the subject of
circumcision which had been addressed to him by
Alonso.<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">176</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The fiscal advocate, or prosecutor of the tribunal,
prepared his case against Yuc&eacute; Franco, and on
December 17, 1490, he came before the court at the
audience of vespers to open the prosecution.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI<br />

<span class="medium">THE TRIAL OF YUC&Eacute; FRANCO</span></h2>

<p>The Fiscal, D. Alonso de Guev&aacute;ra, announces to their
Reverend Paternities that his denunciation of Yuc&eacute;
Franco is prepared, and he solicits them to order the
prisoner to be brought into the audience-chamber
that he may hear it read.</p>

<p>The apparitor of the court introduces the accused
into the presence of the inquisitors and their notary,
to whom Guev&aacute;ra now hands his formal accusation.
This the notary proceeds to read. Thus:</p>

<p>“Most Reverend and Virtuous Sirs,&mdash;I, Alonso
de Guev&aacute;ra, Bachelor of Law, Fiscal Prosecutor of
the Holy Inquisition in this City and Diocese of
Avila, appear before your Reverend Paternities in
the manner by law prescribed, to denounce Yuc&eacute;
Franco, Jew, of the neighbourhood of Tenbleque,
who is present.</p>

<p>“Not content that, in common with all other Jews,
he is humanely permitted to abide and converse with
the faithful and Catholic Christians, he did induce and
attract some Christians to his accursed Law with false
and deceptive doctrines and suggestions, telling them
that the Law of Moses is the true one, in which there
is salvation, and that the Law of Jesus Christ is a false
and fictitious Law never imposed or decreed by God.</p>

<p>“And with infidel and depraved soul he went with
some others to crucify a Christian boy, one Good
Friday, almost in the manner and with that hatred
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span>
and cruelty with which the Jews, his ancestors, crucified
our Redeemer Jesus Christ, mocking and spitting
upon him, striking and wounding him with the aim
of vituperating and deriding our Holy Catholic Faith
and the Passion of our Saviour Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>“Item, he contrived, as principal, together with
others, to obtain a consecrated Host to be outraged
and mocked in vituperation and contempt of our Holy
Catholic Faith, and because amongst the other Jews&mdash;accomplices
in the said crime&mdash;there were certain
sorcerers who on the day of their Passover of unleavened
bread were to commit enchantments with the said Host
and the heart of a Christian boy. And if this were
done, as said, all Christians were to enrage and die.
The intention moving them was that the Law of Moses
should be more widely kept and honoured, its rites
and precepts and ceremonies more freely solemnized,
that the Christian Religion should perish and be
subverted, and that they, themselves, should become
possessed of all the property of the Catholic and
Faithful Christians, and there should be none to
interfere with their perverse errors, and their generation
should grow and multiply upon the earth, that
of the Faithful Christians being entirely extirpated.</p>

<p>“Item, he committed other crimes concerning the
Holy Office of the Holy Inquisition, as I shall state
and allege in the course of these proceedings as far
as I may consider necessary.</p>

<p>“Wherefore I beg you, Reverend Sirs, that you
pronounce the said Yuc&eacute; Franco, for the said crimes,
to be a malefactor, abettor of heretics, and a subverter
and destroyer of the Catholic and Christian Law; and
that he shall be deemed to have fallen into and incurred
all the penalties and censures prescribed by canon and
civil law for those who commit these crimes, and the
confiscation and loss of all his property, which shall be
applied to the royal treasury, and that he may be
abandoned to the secular arm and justice that it may
do with him as by law befits with a malefactor, an
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span>
abettor of heretics, and an extirpator of the Catholic
Faith....</p>

<p>“Wherefore I petition your Reverences to proceed
against the said Yuc&eacute; Franco <i>simpliciter et de plano
et sine estrepitu judicii</i>, as runs the formula prescribed
by law in such cases,<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">177</a> to the end that justice may be
fulfilled.</p>

<p>“And I swear to God on this Cross on which I set
my hand, that this petition and denunciation which
I bring against Yuc&eacute; Franco I do not bring maliciously,
but because I believe him to have committed all that
I have stated, and to the end that justice may be done
and the wicked and the abettors of heretics be punished,
that the good men may be known and that our Holy
Catholic Faith may be exalted.”<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">178</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It will be seen presently that at this stage of the
proceedings Yuc&eacute; had not the slightest suspicion that
the pretended Rabbi Abraham who had visited him
in his prison of Segovia when he lay sick was other
than he had announced himself. Nor did the accusation
afford him the least hint that any of his associates
had been taken, or that Benito Garcia had been
examined under torture. So carefully had they
managed things that he was not even aware of the
arrest of his old father.</p>

<p>Therefore it must have come as something of a
shock to him to hear this matter of the crucifixion of
the child at La Guardia included in the indictment.
Nevertheless he unhesitatingly pronounced the denunciation
to be the “greatest falsehood in the world.”</p>

<p>Guev&aacute;ra answered this denial by petitioning the
court to receive the proofs which he was prepared
to present.</p>

<p>Being asked whether in the preparation of his
defence he would require the services of counsel,
Yuc&eacute; replied in the affirmative, and the tribunal
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span>
appointed as his attorney the Bachelor San&ccedil;,<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">179</a> and
as his advocate Juan de Pantigoso. The usual form
of oath was imposed upon these lawyers, and Yuc&eacute;
empowered them to act for him within the narrow
limitations imposed by the Holy Office, which afforded
them no opportunity to cross-examine the witnesses
for the prosecution or even to be present at their
examination.</p>

<p>The notary of the court was ordered to supply the
defendant with a copy of the indictment, and Yuc&eacute; was
allowed a term of nine days within which to prepare
his answer.</p>

<p>Five days later the accused successfully petitions
the court that to the advocate appointed him be added
one Martin Vazquez, to whom he gives the necessary
powers. And it is this same Martin Vazquez who on
that very day&mdash;December 22, 1490&mdash;presents to the
court the written repudiation of the indictment, prepared
by the Bachelor San&ccedil;, in his client’s name.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The advocate begins by respectfully submitting
that this court has no jurisdiction over his client on
the score of the crimes alleged against him, since their
Paternities are inquisitors appointed&mdash;<i>Auctoritate
Apostolica</i>&mdash;for the Diocese of Avila only, and only
over persons of that diocese. Yuc&eacute; is of the Diocese
of Toledo, where there are inquisitors of heretical
pravity, before whom he is ready to appear to answer
any charges. Therefore his case should have been
referred to that court of Toledo, and their Paternities
should never have received Guev&aacute;ra’s denunciation.</p>

<p>He proceeds to reprove their Paternities for having
done so upon sounder grounds, when he protests that
the accusation is too vague and general and obscure.
It does not state place or year or month or day or
hour in which, or persons with whom, it is alleged
that his client committed the crimes set forth.</p>

<p>Further, he objects that since his client is a Jew,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span>
he cannot with justice be accused of having fallen into
the crime of heresy or apostasy; and therefore it is
not right that&mdash;as may be done in the case of a
heretic&mdash;the full expression and elucidation of what
is charged against him should be withheld, since thus
it is impossible for his client to defend himself, not
knowing what precisely are the charges made.</p>

<p>The advocate very rightly denounces it as against
all equity that the Fiscal should thus prejudice Yuc&eacute;
without particularizing his accusation, and he warns
their Paternities that it may prove hurtful to their
consciences if, as a result of Guev&aacute;ra’s generalizations,
Yuc&eacute; should come to suffer and die undefended.</p>

<p>It is very unsatisfactory equity which says to a
man, “You are accused of such-and-such crimes.
Prove your innocence of them, or we punish you.”
But it is not equity at all that can say, “You are
accused of something; no matter what. Prove to
us that you are innocent of all the offences for which
this tribunal may proceed against you, or we find you
guilty and send you to death.”</p>

<p>This, however, was precisely the method of the
Holy Office, and being aware of it, the advocate is
forced to confess that in a case of heresy secretly
committed the Inquisition may admit an accusation
that does not specify time or place of the alleged
offence.</p>

<p>But this, he insists, does not apply to his client,
who, being a Jew and not having a baptized soul,
may not truly be denounced as a heretic. He appeals
to the consciences of the inquisitors not to admit the
accusation, and finally he threatens that if they do so,
he will lodge a complaint where by right he may.</p>

<p>From all this it appears that so completely&mdash;as
completely as his client&mdash;is the advocate in ignorance
of the mainsprings of the prosecution that he does
not even know that the trial has been ordered by
Torquemada, himself, to take place in Avila. That
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span>
warrant-letter of the Grand Inquisitor’s has not been
divulged to the defendant, lest in learning the names
of his fellow-accused he should learn too much, be
put upon his guard, and equipped to set up a tenable
defence.</p>

<p>But in any case, and to be on the safe side, the
advocate offers a categorical and eloquent denial of
every count in the Fiscal’s indictment.</p>

<p>He scoffs at the absurdity of accusing Yuc&eacute; Franco
of seeking to seduce Christians into embracing the
Law of Moses. He urges the lad’s youth, his station
in life, his general ignorance (even of that same Law
of Moses by which he lives), and the fact that he
has to work hard to make a living by his cobbler’s
trade; and he adduces that his client has neither
the time nor the knowledge necessary to attempt any
such proselytizing as that with which he is charged.</p>

<p>He declares that if at any time Yuc&eacute; did expound
any part of the Mosaic Law in answer to questions
addressed to him (this being obviously inspired by
Yuc&eacute;’s recollection of the statements he has made
under examination concerning Alonso Franco) he did
so simply and frankly, with no thought of proselytizing,
nor could it so be construed. In fact, save
for the answers returned by him to questions asked
by Alonso Franco, the lad does not remember ever
to have done even so much, which would have been
no real offence in any case.</p>

<p>Full and formal, too, is the denial of Yuc&eacute;’s
participation in the crucifixion of any boy, and of
having procured or attempted to procure a Host.
The advocate ridicules the notion of this cobbler-lad
being a sorcerer, or having knowledge of, or interest
in, sorcery.</p>

<p>Finally&mdash;burrowing ever in the dark, and seeking
to undermine possibilities, since he is given no facts
that he may demolish&mdash;he suggests that the depositions
received against Yuc&eacute; are perhaps susceptible
of being interpreted in different ways, and may refer
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span>
equally to good or evil, and that since he is accused
and arrested the things he has, himself, deponed (<i>i.e.</i>
concerning Alonso Franco’s Judaizing tendencies)
should be interpreted in his favour, and not against
him.</p>

<p>Therefore he petitions their Reverend Paternities
to order the witnesses to declare with whom, where,
when, and how Yuc&eacute; committed these things which
are deponed against him. Failing that, he begs them
to declare his client acquitted, to release him, restoring
him his good fame and all property that may
have been confiscated by order of their Paternities or
any other judges of the Inquisition.<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">180</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The court commanded the notary to prepare a
copy of this plea, and to deliver it to the Fiscal, who
was instructed to reply to it within three days. And
they further commanded that at the time of the
delivery of the said reply, Yuc&eacute; Franco should again
be brought before them that he might learn what
was determined concerning him.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The only matter of interest in the next sitting<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">181</a>&mdash;and
this from the point of view of the illustration
which these proceedings afford us of inquisitorial
methods&mdash;is the Fiscal’s repudiation of any obligation on
his part to precise the time or place of the crimes with
which Yuc&eacute; Franco is accused, and his insistence that,
in spite of all that has been advanced by the defendant,
the case must be considered one of heresy.</p>

<p>The court evidently takes the same view, for it
commands both parties to the action to proceed to
advance proof of their respective contentions within
thirty days. Meanwhile, to clear up the matter of
the venue, the court communicates with the Cardinal
of Spain. The Primate very promptly grants the
requisite permission to transfer the action to Avila
from his own Archbishopric of Toledo within whose
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span>
jurisdiction it had lain. This was the merest formality;
for considering the explicit commands in the matter
left by the supreme arbiter, Torquemada, the
Cardinal could hardly have proceeded otherwise.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The methods now adopted by the Fiscal to obtain
the proofs which he requires, or at least to build a
more complete and overwhelming case&mdash;for we cannot
but suppose that already he had sufficient material
upon which to have obtained a conviction&mdash;are
eminently typical.</p>

<p>We know that &Ccedil;a Franco, Benito Garcia, Juan de
Oca&ntilde;a, and the four Francos of La Guardia were all
at this time in the hands of the inquisitors; and it is
not to be doubted that these men would be undergoing
constant examination. But it is obvious, from
the absence in the <i>dossier</i> with which we are concerned
of any document relating to this particular
period, that no avowals were made by his fellow-prisoners
to increase the incrimination of Yuc&eacute;.</p>

<p>Without wishing to set up too many hypotheses to
bridge the <i>lacun&aelig;</i> that result from the absence of the
records of the proceedings against the other accused,
we would tentatively suggest that in preparing that
portion of his denunciation relating to the crucifixion
of the child, Guev&aacute;ra had simply adapted details
extracted from Benito to Yuc&eacute;’s vague admission in
the prison of Segovia. This conclusion is eminently
justifiable. It is based upon the fact that
Guev&aacute;ra altogether overstepped the limits of any
evidence brought to light in the whole course of the
proceedings when he said that Yuc&eacute; “contrived <i>as
principal</i> ... to obtain a consecrated Host.” Further
it is based upon the circumstance already mentioned
that if in any deposition of Benito or of any other
of the accused, Yuc&eacute;’s slightest participation in the
affair of La Guardia had been mentioned, such a
deposition&mdash;or at least the respective extract from
it&mdash;must have found a place in the <i>dossier</i> of his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span>
trial. And we know that no such document is
present.</p>

<p>Still further, we have the fact that the month
prescribed by the court for the submission of proof
was allowed to expire and another month after that,
and still Guev&aacute;ra had no proofs to lay before their
Reverend Paternities, beyond the depositions we have
already seen. Meanwhile, Yuc&eacute; continued to languish
in prison.</p>

<p>And here the following question suggests itself:
In view of the admission made by Yuc&eacute; to the false
Rabbi in Segovia, why was he not closely and directly
questioned upon that matter? and in the event of his
withholding details, why was he not put to torture as
by law prescribed?</p>

<p>Instead of that direct method of procedure, he was
left in complete ignorance of his self-betrayal and of
the source whence the inquisitors had derived their
knowledge of his association with the affair of La
Guardia.</p>

<p>The only answer that suggests itself is that
Torquemada desired the matter to be very fully
elucidated, that the net should be very fully and
carefully spread&mdash;as we shall see&mdash;so that nothing
and no one should escape. And yet this answer is
hardly entirely satisfactory.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>If Guev&aacute;ra allowed months to pass without being
able to lay the required proofs of Yuc&eacute;’s guilt before
the court, on the other hand Yuc&eacute; himself had been
similarly unable to supply his counsel with any proof
of his innocence&mdash;as indeed was impossible in the
absence of all particulars of the charges against him.</p>

<p>Thus for a season the case remains in suspense.</p>

<p>Attempts to extract incriminating evidence from
the other prisoners having meanwhile failed by
ordinary judicial methods, the tribunal now has recourse
to other means. Having failed to compel or
induce the prisoners into betraying one another,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">303</span>
the inquisitors now seek to lure them into self-betrayal.</p>

<p>A well-known scheme is employed.</p>

<p>Benito is moved into a chamber immediately under
Yuc&eacute;’s. To while away the tedium of his imprisonment,
and with a light-heartedness that is a little startling in
a man in his desperate position, Yuc&eacute; sits by his window
thrumming a viol or guitar one day towards the end of
March or in early April. The instrument may have
been left with him by the gaoler who was in the plot.</p>

<p>What was no doubt expected comes to pass.
Yuc&eacute;’s music is abruptly interrupted by a voice from
below, which asks:</p>

<p>“Can you give me a needle, Jew?”</p>

<p>Yuc&eacute; replies that he has no needle other than a
cobbler’s.<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">182</a></p>

<p>The speaker is Benito Garcia, and it is certain
that spies have been set to overhear what passes.
We know that their conversation took place through
a hole in the floor contrived by the gaoler, who was
acting upon the instructions of the inquisitors.<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">183</a></p>

<p>Yuc&eacute; is very circumspect in all that he says; but
Benito is entirely reckless during those first days of
their intercourse. And yet, whilst he admits that he
considers himself lost already through what “that dog
of a doctor” (by which he means the Reverend Inquisitor,
Dr. Villada) extracted from him under torture
in Astorga, he shows himself at other times not
without hope of regaining his freedom.</p>

<p>He mentions a man named Pe&ntilde;a, who is the
Alcalde of La Guardia. This man, he says, is interested
in him, and has&mdash;or so Benito fancies&mdash;influence
at Court which he would exert on Benito’s
behalf did he but know of the latter’s position.</p>

<p>At another time he vows that, if ever he gets out
of prison, he will quit Spain and take himself off to
Judea. He is convinced that all this trouble has come
upon him as a punishment for having abandoned the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span>
Law of Moses and denied the true God to embrace the
religion of the Begotten God (<i>Dios Parido</i>).</p>

<p>But apart from these, there are no lamentations
from him; more usually he is sardonic in his grievances,
as when he complains that all he got in
return for the money he gave for the souls in
purgatory were the fleas and lice that all but devoured
him alive in the prison of Astorga; or that all the
recompense he enjoyed for having presented the
Church with a holy-water font was to be subjected
to the water-torture by “that dog of a doctor in
Astorga.”</p>

<p>He vows that he will die a Jew, though he should
be burnt alive. He inveighs bitterly against the
inquisitors, dubbing them Antichrists, and Torquemada
the greatest Antichrist of all; and he alludes derisively
to what he terms the frauds and buffooneries of the
Church.</p>

<p>It was from Benito that Yuc&eacute;, to his surprise,
received news of his father’s arrest and of the fact that
&Ccedil;a Franco lies in that same prison of Avila. He was
informed of this during their first talk, when Benito
reproved his music.</p>

<p>“Don’t thrum that guitar,” Benito had said, “but
take pity on your father who is here and whom the
inquisitors have promised to burn.”<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">184</a></p>

<p>In the course of another later conversation between
the prisoners Yuc&eacute; asks Benito what has brought
about the latter’s arrest. And when Benito has related
the happening in the inn at Astorga, Yuc&eacute; questions
him on the subject of the consecrated wafer&mdash;and his
questions certainly betray the fact that the young Jew
had previous knowledge of it and generally of the
affair that was afoot. He becomes so importunate in
his questions that Benito&mdash;perhaps finding them
awkward to answer without betraying the extent to
which he has incriminated his associates&mdash;sharply bids
Yuc&eacute; to leave the matter alone, assuring him at the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span>
same time that he has never mentioned Yuc&eacute;’s name
to the inquisitors.</p>

<div id="i_304" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_304.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="small"><i>Photo by Donald Macbeth.</i></p>

<p class="caption">SANBENITO OF PENITENT ADMITTED TO RECONCILIATION.<br />
From Limborch’s “Historia Inquisitionis.”</p>
</div>

<p>At first glance this statement appears untrue. But
it is obvious that Benito means that he has never
mentioned Yuc&eacute;’s name in connection with the Host
or in any other way that could incriminate him. And
in this he is truthful enough as far as he knows, for he
could not suppose that what he had said about his own
offences against the Faith committed in Yuc&eacute;’s house
at Tenbleque could in any way be construed against
the lad or his father.</p>

<p>Passing on to other matters, they refer to a certain
widow of La Guardia, of whom Benito says that he
knows her to be a Judaizer, because she never ate
anything containing lard or ham, and he has frequently
seen her eat <i>adafinas</i> (the Jewish food prepared on the
Friday for the Sabbath) and drink <i>Caser</i> wine.<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">185</a></p>

<p>In the <i>dossier</i> of Yuc&eacute; Franco there are no depositions
of the spy set to overhear his conversations with
Benito. But it is probable that some such depositions
will be found in the record of the trial of the latter,
where they must belong, since from the frankness
which he used he incriminated himself to an extraordinary
degree and Yuc&eacute; not at all. And it is not to
be doubted that the inquisitors made use of information
thus obtained when they came to examine Yuc&eacute; Franco
on April 9 and 10<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">186</a> and in a subsequent examination
of August 1,<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">187</a> when they drew from him a deposition
which embodies all the foregoing.</p>

<p>On the margin of the last of these depositions
there is a note drawing attention to what was said
by Benito concerning the widow of La Guardia,
which shows that the inquisitors do not intend that
this piece of chance information shall be wasted.</p>

<p>Acting no doubt upon the report of the spy, and
having at last obtained information upon which they
could go to work, the inquisitors, Villada and Lopes,
accompanied by their notary, pay Yuc&eacute; Franco a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span>
surprise visit in his cell on the morning of Saturday,
April 9. Having obtained his ratification of what he
has already deponed at Segovia and in this prison of
Avila, they draw from him by vague and subtle
questionings the following additions to those admissions:</p>

<p>About three years ago he was told by a Hebrew
physician, named Yuc&eacute; Tazarte, since deceased, that
the latter had begged Benito Garcia to obtain him a
consecrated wafer, and that Benito had stolen the keys
of the church of La Guardia and so contrived to
obtain a Host; that in consequence of that theft,
Benito was arrested&mdash;upon suspicion, we suppose&mdash;two
years ago last Christmas (<i>i.e.</i> 1488), and detained
in prison for two days.</p>

<p>Tazarte told Yuc&eacute; that the wafer was required “to
make a cord with certain knots,” which cord, together
with a letter, Tazarte gave the witness for delivery to
the Rabbi Peres of Toledo, with which request Yuc&eacute;
had complied.</p>

<p>But beyond this, he adds, he has no knowledge of
what became of the Host, nor did Tazarte tell him;
and that not only Tazarte, but also Benito Garcia,
Mos&eacute; Franco&mdash;his own brother, since deceased&mdash;and
Alonso Franco of La Guardia, were mixed up in the
affair, according to what had been related by Mos&eacute; to
his wife Jamila. In this last particular he presently
corrected himself: it was not, he says upon reflection,
to Jamila that Mos&eacute; had related this, but to Yuc&eacute;
himself.</p>

<p>It is a curious statement, and would no doubt be
made in answer to the trend of the questions set him
as to what he knew of a certain Host that had been
used for purposes of magic. And there is reason to
believe that&mdash;as we shall see presently&mdash;Yuc&eacute; was
deliberately lying, in the hope of putting the inquisitors
off the scent of the real affair.</p>

<p>But it is noteworthy that in this, as in other
depositions, he is careful to betray no Jews whom
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">307</span>
his evidence can hurt. His brother and Tazarte are
dead; Alonso and Benito Garcia are already under
arrest, and the latter has admitted to Yuc&eacute; that he has
already said enough to burn him. Moreover, they
are Christians&mdash;having received baptism&mdash;and their
betrayal cannot be to Yuc&eacute; as serious a matter as
would that of a faithful Jew. Particularly is this
emphasized by his retraction of what he had said
concerning the slight connection of his sister-in-law
Jamila with the affair, having perhaps bethought him
that even so little might incriminate her&mdash;as undoubtedly
it would have done.</p>

<p>The inquisitors withdraw, obviously dissatisfied,
and later on that same day they order Yuc&eacute; to be
brought before them in the audience-chamber. There
they recommence their questions, and they succeed
in extracting from him a considerable portion of what
passed between him and Benito in prison&mdash;matters
of which, beyond all doubt, they would be already
fully informed.</p>

<p>Twice on the following day, which was Sunday, was
he haled before their Reverend Paternities. At the
first audience his statement of yesterday is read over
to him, and when he has ratified it he is again pressed
with stealthy questions to add a little more of what
passed in those conversations with Benito. But in
the course of the second examination on that Sunday,
Yuc&eacute; is at last induced or betrayed into supplying
the inquisitors with information nearer their requirements.</p>

<p>He says that four years ago he was told by his
brother Mos&eacute; that the latter, with Tazarte, Alonso
Franco, Juan Franco, Garcia Franco, and Benito
Garcia had obtained a consecrated wafer, and that by
certain incantations they were to contrive that the
justice of the Christians and the inquisitors should
not have power to touch them. Mos&eacute; invited him to
join in the affair, but he refused to do so, having no
inclination, and being, moreover, on his way to Murcia
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span>
at the time. And he knows, from what Mos&eacute; told
him, that about two years ago the same men repeated
the same enchantment with the same Host.<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">188</a></p>

<p>We do not know whether Yuc&eacute; is now left in peace
for a whole month, but we cannot suppose it. And
we have to explain the absence of any report of an
examination during that period by the assumption
that whatever examinations did take place were
entirely fruitless and brought no fresh particulars to
light. As the <i>dossier</i> does not anywhere contain a
single record of a fruitless examination, this assumption&mdash;although
we admit its negative character&mdash;does
not seem unreasonable.</p>

<p>Anyway, on May 7 it is Yuc&eacute; himself who begs to
be taken before the inquisitors to tell them that he
remembers having asked Mos&eacute; where he and his associates
assembled to do what they did, so that the wives
of the latter&mdash;who were Christian women&mdash;should
have no knowledge of the affair, and Mos&eacute; had
answered him that they assembled in the caves
between Dosbarrios and La Guardia, on the road to
Oca&ntilde;a.<a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">189</a></p>

<p>It is difficult to suppose such a statement to be
entirely spontaneous as following upon depositions
made a month earlier. Much rather does it appear to
be the result of some fruitless questionings such as we
suggest may have taken place in the interval. Similarly
we assume that the examinations steadily continue,
but another month passes before we get the next
recorded one, and this&mdash;on June 9<a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">190</a>&mdash;contains a really
important admission.</p>

<p>He says that <i>he doesn’t remember whether</i> he has
mentioned that some four years ago, being ill at
Tenbleque and the physician Tazarte having come to
bleed him, he overheard a conversation between his
brother and Tazarte, from which he learnt that the
latter, together with the Francos of La Guardia, had
performed an enchantment with a Host and the heart
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">309</span>
of a Christian boy, by virtue of which the inquisitors
could take no proceedings against them in any way,
or, if they did, the inquisitors themselves would die.</p>

<p>His statement that he doesn’t remember whether
he had mentioned a matter of so grave a character is
either a foolish attempt to simulate guilelessness, or
else, in itself, it suggests a bewildered state of mind
resulting from the multiplication of examinations in
which this matter of the heart of a Christian boy&mdash;contained,
as we know, in Guev&aacute;ra’s indictment&mdash;has
been persistently thrust forward.</p>

<div id="i_309" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_309.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">THE DISTRICT OF LA GUARDIA.</p>
</div>

<p>He is asked whether he heard tell whence they
procured the Host, and where they killed the boy to
obtain the heart. But he denies having overheard
anything, or having otherwise obtained any knowledge
of these particulars.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We have seen Eymeric’s prescription for visiting
a prisoner and assuring him that the inquisitors will
pardon him if he makes a frank and full confession of
his crime and of all that is known to him of the crimes
of others. Although it is not positively indicated,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span>
there is reason to suppose from what follows that this
course was now being pursued in the case of Yuc&eacute;
Franco. To play the part of the necessary mediator,
the inquisitors have at hand the gaoler who must have
been on friendly terms with the prisoner, having contrived
for him a means of communication with Benito
at the time when the latter had occupied the cell
immediately beneath Yuc&eacute;’s. That Benito no longer
occupies this cell may safely be assumed; for having
served his turn, he would of course be removed
again.</p>

<p>Whatever the steps that were taken to bring it
about, on July 19&mdash;a little over a year after his arrest&mdash;Yuc&eacute;
is brought before Villada and Lopes,<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">191</a> at his
own request, for the purpose of making certain
additions to <i>what he has already deponed</i>.</p>

<p>He begins by begging their Paternities to forgive
him for not having earlier confessed all that he knew,
protesting that such is now his intention, provided
that they will pass him their word assuring him of
pardon and immunity for himself and his father for all
errors committed.<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">192</a></p>

<p>It certainly seems that without previous assurance
that some such consideration was intended towards
him, he would never have ventured to prefer a request
of this nature, at once incriminating&mdash;since it admitted
his possession of knowledge hitherto withheld&mdash;and
impudent in its assumption that such information would
be purchased at the price he named.</p>

<p>The inquisitors benignly answered him that they
agreed to do so upon the understanding that in all he
should tell them the entire truth, and they warned him
that they would soon be able more or less to perceive
whether he was telling the truth.<a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">193</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">311</span></p>

<p>(This pretence of being already fully informed is
the ruse counselled by Eymeric to persuade the person
under examination of the futility of resorting to
subterfuge.)</p>

<p>Reassured by this answer, and deluded no doubt
by the apparent promise of pardon conditional upon a
full confession, Yuc&eacute; begins by offering, as an apology
for his past silence upon the matters he is about to
relate, the statement that this has been due to an oath
which he swore not to divulge anything until he should
have been in prison for a year.</p>

<p>Thereupon he is sworn in the Jewish manner to
speak the entire truth without fraud or evasions or
concealment of anything known by him to concern
the Holy Office of the Inquisition, and he addresses
himself to the task of amplifying and rectifying what
he has previously said.</p>

<p>His confession is that once some three years ago
he had been in a cave situated a little way back from
the road that runs from La Guardia to Dosbarrios,
on the right-hand side as you go towards the latter
place, and midway between the two villages. There
were present, in addition to himself, his father,
&Ccedil;a Franco, his brother Mos&eacute;, since deceased, the
physician Yuc&eacute; Tazarte and one David Perejon&mdash;both
deceased&mdash;Benito Garcia, Juan de Oca&ntilde;a, and
the four Francos of La Guardia&mdash;Juan, Alonso, Lope,
and Garcia.</p>

<p>Alonso Franco had shown him a heart, which he
said had been cut out of a Christian boy, and from
its condition Yuc&eacute; judged that this had been lately
done. Further, Alonso had shown him a wafer,
which he said was consecrated. This wafer and the
heart Alonso enclosed together in a wooden box
which he delivered to Tazarte, and the latter took
these things apart, saying that he went to perform
an enchantment so that the inquisitors could
not hurt any of them, or, if they attempted to do
so, they must themselves go mad and die within a year.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span></p>

<p>At this point the inquisitors interpolate two
questions:</p>

<p>“Does he know whence the Host was obtained?”</p>

<p>“Does he know whether they sacrificed any boy
to procure the heart?”</p>

<p>His answer to the first is in the negative&mdash;he has
no knowledge.</p>

<p>To the second question he replies that he remembers
hearing Alonso Franco state that he and
some of his brothers crucified a Christian boy whose
heart this was.</p>

<p>Resuming his statement, he says that some two years
ago all the above-mentioned assembled again between
La Guardia and Tenbleque, and that on this occasion
it was agreed to send a consecrated wafer to Mos&eacute;
Abenamias of Zamora, and that such a Host was
delivered to Benito Garcia enclosed in parchment
tied with red silk. This, Benito was to take to
Abenamias, together with a letter which had first
been written in Hebrew, but which&mdash;lest this should
excite suspicion in the event of the letter’s being
discovered&mdash;was replaced by another one written in
Romance.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The interpretation to place upon this seems to be
that, doubts having arisen as to the efficacy of the
enchantments performed by Tazarte, it was deemed
expedient to have recourse to a magician of greater
repute, and to send a consecrated wafer to Abenamias
in Zamora, that he might accomplish with it the
desired sorcery.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The inquisitors press Yuc&eacute; to say whether he
knows if Benito did actually deliver the wafer to
Abenamias. He replies that he doesn’t know what
Benito did with it; but that he has been told by
Benito [in the course of their conversations in the
prison of Avila] that he went upon a journey to
Santiago, and that in passing through Astorga he was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span>
arrested by order of Dr. Villada, who was the provisor
there at the time.</p>

<p>As for the heart, he doesn’t know what happened
to it; but he believes that it remained in the possession
of Tazarte, who performed his enchantments
with it.</p>

<p>Questioned as to who was the leading spirit in the
affair, he replies that Tazarte invited him together
with his father and his brother Mos&eacute;, and that they
all went together to the cave, whilst he believes that
the Christians (<i>i.e.</i> Oca&ntilde;a, the Francos, and Benito
Garcia) and David Perejon from La Guardia were
also summoned by Tazarte.</p>

<p>Finally he is asked whether Tazarte received any
money for his sorceries, and whether Benito Garcia
was paid to convey the Host to Zamora; and he
answers that money was given by Alonso Franco to
Tazarte, and that Benito too would be paid for his
trouble.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>From a ratification on the next day (July 20) of
a confession made by the octogenarian &Ccedil;a Franco,
it becomes clear that immediately upon dismissing
Yuc&eacute;, his father was introduced into the audience-chamber
for examination.</p>

<p>The inquisitors are now possessed of the information
that &Ccedil;a was present in the cave when Alonso
Franco produced the heart of a Christian child.
Working upon this and upon the other details
obtained from Yuc&eacute;, they would now be able, by
a clever parade of these&mdash;and a seemingly intentional
reticence as to the rest&mdash;convincingly to feign the
fullest and completest knowledge of the affair. Thus
does the “Directorium” enjoin the inquisitor to
conduct his examination.</p>

<p>Believing that all is betrayed, and that further
concealment will, therefore, be worse than useless,
&Ccedil;a at last speaks out. He not only confirms all
that his son has already admitted, but he adds a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">314</span>
great deal more. He confesses that he himself, his
two sons and the other Jews and Christians mentioned,
assembled in a cave on the right-hand side of
the road that runs from La Guardia to Dosbarrios,
and he says that some of them brought thither a
Christian boy who was there crucified upon two
timbers rectangularly crossed, to which they bound
him. Before proceeding to do this, the boy was
stripped by the Christians, who whipped and otherwise
vituperated him.</p>

<p>He protests that he, himself, took no part in this
beyond being present and witnessing all that was done.
Pressed as to what part was taken by his son Yuc&eacute;, he
admits that he saw the latter give the boy a light push
or blow.</p>

<p>It is to this mention of Yuc&eacute; that we owe the inclusion
in the present <i>dossier</i> of this extract from &Ccedil;a’s ratification
of his confession, which reveals to us so clearly
the method pursued by the tribunal.</p>

<p>&Ccedil;a is removed, and Yuc&eacute; is forthwith brought
back again. Questions recommence, shaped now
upon the further information gained, and betraying
enough of the extent of that information to compel
Yuc&eacute; to amplify his admissions.</p>

<p>No doubt they would question him directly upon
the matter of the crucifixion of the boy, insisting upon
this&mdash;now the main charge&mdash;and depending upon
Yuc&eacute;’s replies to supply them with further details than
they already possess, so as to enable them to probe
still deeper.</p>

<p>Unable to persist in denial in the face of so much
obvious knowledge on the part of his questioners,
Yuc&eacute; admits having witnessed the actual crucifixion
in the cave some three or four years ago. He says
(as his father had said) that it was the Christians who
crucified the child, and that they whipped him, struck
him, spat upon him, and crowned him with thorns.</p>

<p>So far he merely confirms what is already known.
But now he adds to the sum of that knowledge. He
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">315</span>
states that Alonso Franco opened the veins of the
boy’s arms and left him to bleed for over half an hour,
gathering the blood in a cauldron and a jar; that
Juan Franco drew a Bohemian knife (<i>i.e.</i> a curved
knife) and thrust it into the boy’s side, and that Garcia
Franco took out the heart and sprinkled it with salt.</p>

<p>He admits that all who were present took part
in what was done, and he is able to indicate the
precise part played by each, with the exception of his
father: he doesn’t remember having seen his father
do anything beyond just standing there while all this
was going on; and Yuc&eacute; reminds the inquisitors that
his father is a very old man of over eighty years of
age, whose sight is so feeble that he couldn’t so much
as see clearly what was being done.</p>

<p>When the child was dead, he continues, they took
him down from the cross. (They untied him, he says.)
Juan Franco seized his arms, and Garcia Franco his
legs, and thus they bore him out of the cave. Yuc&eacute;
didn’t see where they took him, but he heard Juan
Franco and Garcia Franco informing Tazarte that they
had buried him in a ravine by the river Escorchon.</p>

<p>The heart remained in the possession of Alonso
until their next meeting in the cave, when he gave it,
together with the consecrated wafer, to Tazarte.</p>

<p>“Did this,” they ask him, “take place by day or
by night?”</p>

<p>“By night,” he answers, “by the light of candles
of white wax; and a cloak was hung over the mouth
of the cave that the light might not be seen outside.”</p>

<p>He is desired to say when precisely was this; but
all that he can answer is that he thinks it was in Lent,
just before Easter, three or four years ago.</p>

<p>They ask whether he had heard any rumours of
the loss of a child at about that time in that district,
and he says that he heard rumours of a child lost in
Lillo and another in La Guardia; the latter had gone
to a vineyard with his uncle, and had never been
seen again. But he adds that, in any case, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">316</span>
Francos came and went between La Guardia and
Murcia, and that on one of their journeys they might
easily have found a child and carried it off, because
they had sardine barrels in their carts, and some of
those would be empty&mdash;by which he means that they
could have concealed the child in one of these barrels.</p>

<p>Urged to give still further details, he protests that
he can remember no more at present, but promises
to inform the court if he does succeed in recalling
anything else.</p>

<p>He is dismissed upon that with an injunction from
Dr. Villada&mdash;which may have been backed by a
promise or a threat&mdash;to reflect and to confess all
that he knows to be the business of the Holy Office
concerning himself or any others.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">317</span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII<br />

<span class="medium">THE TRIAL OF YUC&Eacute; FRANCO (<i>Continued</i>)</span></h2>

<p>It is not difficult to conjecture with what fresh energies
the court&mdash;armed with such information as it now
possessed&mdash;proceeded to re-examine the other seven
prisoners accused of complicity in the crime of La
Guardia, pressing each with the particular share he
was himself alleged to have borne in the affair, and
continuing to play off one accused against another.</p>

<p>It is regrettable that the records of these proceedings
should not at present be available, so that all
conjecture might be dispensed with in reconstructing
step by step this extraordinary case. And it is to be
hoped that M. Fidel Fita’s expectations that these
records will ultimately be brought to light may come
to be realized.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A week later, on July 28, Yuc&eacute; is again brought
into the audience-chamber for further examination.
But he has nothing more to add on the subject of
the actual crime. All that he has contrived to remember
in the interval are scraps of conversation that
took place when the culprits assembled&mdash;on that later
occasion&mdash;for the purpose of sending the consecrated
wafer to Abenamias. Nevertheless, what he says is,
from the point of view of the inquisitors, as damaging
to those who uttered the things which he repeats as
their actual participation in the crucifixion of the boy,
and it is hardly less damaging to Yuc&eacute; himself, since it
shows him to have been a <i>fautor</i>, or abettor of heretics&mdash;a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">318</span>
circumstance which he may very well entirely have
failed to appreciate.</p>

<p>He depones that Alonso Franco had said that the
letter they were dispatching to Abenamias was better
than the letters and bulls [of indulgence] that came from
Rome and were offered for sale. Oca&ntilde;a agreed by
launching an imprecation upon all who should spend
money on such bulls, denouncing such things as sheer
humbug (<i>todo es burla</i>), and protesting that there is no
saviour other than God. But Garcia Franco reproved
him with the reminder that it was good policy to buy
one now and then, as it gave them the appearance of
being good Catholics.</p>

<p>On this same subject of appearances, Alonso grumbled
at the trouble to which they were put by the
fact of their being married to Old-Christian women
who would not even permit the circumcision of their
children.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Three days later Yuc&eacute; has remembered that it was
Benito who crowned the child with thorns. He is
again questioned as to what he knows about the boy,
and he admits having heard Tazarte say that the
child was obtained “from a place whence it would
never be missed.”</p>

<p>They press him further on the subject, but he can
only repeat what he has already said&mdash;that as the
Francos travel a great deal with their carts, they may
have found the boy on one of their journeys.</p>

<p>As no more is to be extracted from him on the
subject, they now change the line of examination, and
seek information concerning other Judaizing practices
of the Francos of La Guardia, asking Yuc&eacute; what he
knows upon this matter.</p>

<p>He answers that about six years ago the Francos,
to his own knowledge, kept the Feast of the Tabernacles
and gave the beggar Perejon money to buy a
trumpet which was to be sounded on the seventh day
of the feast, as is proper. He knows, further, that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">319</span>
they sit down to meat prepared in the Jewish manner,
over which they utter Jewish prayers&mdash;the <i>Berak&aacute;</i> and
the <i>Hamo&ccedil;i</i>&mdash;and that they are believed to have kept
the great fast and to give money for the purchase of
oil for the synagogue.<a id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">194</a></p>

<p>Asked further to explain the oath of secrecy which
he says was imposed upon him and to which he has
said that his past silence has been due, he states that
all were solemnly sworn by Tazarte that under no
circumstances would they utter a word of what was
done in the cave between Dosbarrios and La Guardia
until they should have been one year in the prison
of the Inquisition, and that even should the torture
betray them into infidelity to their oath, they must
refuse to ratify afterwards, and deny what they might
have divulged.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>M. Isidore Loeb clung so tenaciously to the theory
that the affair of the “Santo Ni&ntilde;o” was trumped up
by Torquemada that he would not permit his convictions
to be shaken by the revelations contained in
these records of Yuc&eacute;’s trial when they came to light.
He fastens upon this statement of Yuc&eacute;’s and denounces
such an oath as a flagrant absurdity, concluding thence
that here, as elsewhere, Yuc&eacute; is lying.<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">195</a></p>

<p>M. Loeb’s criticisms of this <i>dossier</i> are worthy of
too much attention to be lightly passed over, and we
shall return presently to the consideration of them.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile we may permit ourselves a
digression here to consider just this point upon which
he bases so much argument for the purpose of proving
false the rest of the story.</p>

<p>If we were to agree with M. Loeb that Yuc&eacute; is
lying in this instance, that would still prove nothing as
to the rest&mdash;and it would be very far from proving
that Torquemada is the inventor of the whole affair.
Assuming that this tale of an oath of silence to endure
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">320</span>
for one year after arrest is a falsehood, it may very
well be urged that it is employed by Yuc&eacute; in the
hope that it will excuse his having hitherto withheld
information and that it will induce the inquisitors to
deal leniently with him for that same silence. Let it
be observed that he prefaces his confession with that
excuse at the time of asking the inquisitors to give
him an undertaking that they will pardon him if he
divulges all that he knows.</p>

<p>But is he really lying?</p>

<p>It seems to us that in arriving at this conclusion,
M. Loeb has either overlooked or else not sufficiently
weighed the following statement in Yuc&eacute;’s confession:
“<i>Yuc&eacute; Tazarte ... went to perform an enchantment
so that the inquisitors could not hurt any of them, or
if they attempted to do so they must, themselves, go mad
and die</i> within a year.” This means, of course, within
a year of attempting to hurt any of them, which again
means <i>within a year of the arrest of any of them</i>.</p>

<p>Now, the fact of our not believing to-day in the
efficacy of Tazarte’s incantations and in the power of
his magic spells with the heart and the Host to
accomplish the things he promised, is no reason to
suppose that Tazarte himself was not firmly persuaded
that his enchantments would take effect. Indeed, he
and his associates must firmly have believed it, or they
would never have gone the length of imperilling their
lives in so dangerous a business.</p>

<p>Tazarte’s belief was that these sorceries would
invest them all with an immunity from inquisitorial
persecution, and that should any inquisitors attempt
to violate that immunity, such inquisitors must go mad
and die within a year of arresting any of Tazarte’s
associates. Therefore in the event of arrest, all that
would be necessary to procure ultimate deliverance
would be stubbornly to withhold from the inquisitors
all information on the subject of this enchantment
until the period within which it was to work should
have expired.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">321</span></p>

<p>When this is sufficiently considered, it seems to us
that such an oath as Yuc&eacute; says was imposed by
Tazarte becomes not only likely but absolutely inevitable.
Some such oath must have been imposed to
ensure the efficacy of the enchantment in the event of
the arrest of any of them.</p>

<p>It is difficult to think that Tazarte was a mere
charlatan performing this business with his tongue in
his cheek for the sake of the money he could extract
from his dupes; difficult, because he was dealing with
comparatively poor people, from whom the remuneration
to be obtained would be out of all proportion to the
risk incurred. But even if we proceed upon that
assumption, are we not to conclude that, being a
deliberate charlatan, Tazarte would be at great pains
to appear sincere and to impose an oath which he must
have imposed if he were sincere?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It is rather singular and it seems to ask some
explanation, which it is not in our power to afford,
that not until now do the inquisitors make any use
of that grave admission of Yuc&eacute;’s to the supposed
Rabbi Abraham in Segovia. It is true that it was
extremely vague, but in &Ccedil;a’s admissions of July 19&mdash;if
not before&mdash;they had obtained the connecting link
required.</p>

<p>But not until September 16, when they pay Yuc&eacute;
a visit in his cell, do they touch upon the matter.
They then ask him whether he recollects having talked
when under arrest in Segovia, upon matters concerning
the Inquisition, and with whom.</p>

<p>His answer certainly seems to show that even now
he has no suspicion that the “Rabbi Abraham” was
an emissary of the Holy Office. He says that being
sick in prison and believing that he was about to die,
he asked the physician who tended him to beg the
inquisitors to allow him to be visited by a Jew to pray
with him, and his further admissions as to what passed
between himself and the “Rabbi” entirely corroborate
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">322</span>
the depositions of Frey Alonso Enriquez and the physician
Antonio de Avila.</p>

<p>The inquisitors ask him to explain the three Hebrew
words he used on that occasion: <i>mita</i>, <i>nahar</i>, and
<i>Otohays</i>. He replies that they referred to the crucifixion
of the boy, as related by him in his confession.<a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">196</a></p>

<p>At this stage it would almost seem to transpire
that Benito’s admissions under torture at Astorga,
when, as he has said, he admitted enough to burn him,
must have been confined to matters concerning the
Host found upon him, and that until now he has said
nothing about the crucifixion of the boy.</p>

<p>This assumption is one that deepens the mysterious
parts of the affair rather than elucidates them, for
it leaves us without the faintest indication of how
the Fiscal Guev&aacute;ra was able to incorporate in his
indictment nine months ago the particulars of
“enchantments with the said Host and heart of a
Christian boy.”</p>

<p>From what Benito has said to Yuc&eacute; in prison we
might be justified in supposing that the former is the
delator; but in view of the turn now taken by the proceedings
this supposition seems to become untenable.
It is of course possible that the particulars in question may
have been wrung out of one of the other prisoners, or
it is possible that Benito himself may have confessed
and afterwards refused to ratify. But beyond indicating
these possibilities we cannot go.</p>

<p>The fact remains that on September 24 the
inquisitors found it necessary to put Benito Garcia to
torture that they might obtain his evidence relating to
the crucifixion.</p>

<p>And on the rack he confesses that he and
Yuc&eacute; Franco and the others crucified a boy in one
of the caves on the road to Villapalomas on a cross
made of a beam and the axle of a cart lashed together
with a rope of hemp; that first they tied the boy to
the cross and then nailed his hands and feet to it; and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">323</span>
that as the boy was screaming they strangled or stifled
him (<i>lo ahogaron</i>); that all was done at night, by the
light of a candle which Benito himself had procured
from Santa Maria de la Pera; that the mouth of the
cave was covered with a cloak, so that the light should
not be seen outside; that the boy was whipped
with a strap and crowned with thorns&mdash;all in mockery
and vituperation of our Lord Jesus Christ; and that
they took the body away and buried it in a vineyard
near Santa Maria de la Pera.<a id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">197</a></p>

<p>There are some slight discrepancies between the
details of the affair afforded by Benito and those given
by Yuc&eacute;. The latter has not mentioned that the
child’s hands and feet were nailed to the cross;
according to him they were merely tied. Nor has
he said that the boy was strangled; his statement
seems to be that the child was bled to death, as a
consequence of opening the veins of his arms&mdash;a matter
which Benito does not mention. But on the score
of the strangling, it is possible that by the word
employed&mdash;<i>ahogaron</i>&mdash;Benito merely means that the
boy’s cries were stifled, a detail which would be confirmed
by Yuc&eacute;’s statement that the child was gagged.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The prisoners are evidently permitted to learn
that Benito has been tortured. Very possibly they
are given the information to the end that it may strike
terror into them and so induce them to betray themselves
without more ado. But it does not seem that
they are very greatly frightened by the prospect of
having to undergo the same suffering, if we are to
judge by Garcia Franco. This prisoner is permitted
on the following day (which is Sunday), by contrivance
of the Holy Office, to get into communication with
Yuc&eacute;. In the course of their conversation Garcia
strongly urges a policy of denial under torture, should
they be subjected to it,<a id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">198</a> from which it seems plain
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">324</span>
that he has no notion of the extent to which Yuc&eacute;’s
tongue has been loosened already.</p>

<p>On the following Wednesday it is Juan Franco’s
turn to be put to the torture.</p>

<p>Under it he gives a general confirmation of what
has already been extracted from the others. He
confesses that he and Yuc&eacute; Franco and the other
Christians and Jews crucified a boy in the cave of
Carre Oca&ntilde;a, which is on the right going from La
Guardia to Oca&ntilde;a; that they crucified him on a cross
made of two beams of olive-wood lashed together by
a rope of hemp; that they whipped him with a rope;
and that Yuc&eacute; was present when the deponent
himself cut out the boy’s heart&mdash;as is more fully
contained in the deponent’s confession (of which,
again, this is no more than an extract relating to
Yuc&eacute;’s share in the crime). He states that an enchantment
was performed with the heart, so that the
Inquisition might not proceed against them.</p>

<p>This confession was duly ratified upon the
morrow.<a id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">199</a></p>

<p>On the Friday of the same week they torture
Juan de Oca&ntilde;a and extract from him a confession
that is, in the main, in agreement with those already
obtained. He relates how he and the others crucified
a boy in the caves of Carre Oca&ntilde;a; that they whipped
him with ropes when he was crucified; that they cut
out his heart and caught his blood in a cauldron; that
it was night and that they had a light; and that when
they took the body down they buried it near Santa
Maria de la Pera, as fully set forth in his confession.<a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">200</a></p>

<p>As a consequence of his having in the course of
this confession spoken of the Host that was sent to
Zamora for delivery to Abenamias, Oca&ntilde;a is questioned
again&mdash;on October 11&mdash;touching this particular. He
is asked how he knows that this was done. He
replies that he heard Alonso Franco and the Jews&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>
&Ccedil;a Franco and his sons (Yuc&eacute; and Mos&eacute;), Tazarte
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">325</span>
and Perejon&mdash;say that such was the intention, but he
doesn’t know whether the Host was actually delivered
or otherwise disposed of.</p>

<p>The persistence with which this apparently trivial
question arises&mdash;particularly when it is remembered
that the inquisitors were, themselves, in possession
of the Host found upon Benito at the time of his
arrest&mdash;leads us to suppose that they were probing
to discover whether this consecrated wafer was the
identical one dispatched upon the occasion to which
the confessions refer. Considering the lapse of time
between the dispatch of that wafer and Benito’s arrest,
they may reasonably have been concluding that the
Host found upon the latter relates to some similar,
later affair. Such an impression is confirmed by the
fact that no letter&mdash;such as was addressed to Abenamias&mdash;had
been discovered upon Benito.</p>

<p>The question again crops up in an examination to
which Yuc&eacute; is submitted on that same day.</p>

<p>“Did any of the Jews or Christians,” he is asked,
“go to Zamora to Abenamias in this matter?”</p>

<p>He answers precisely as he has answered before:
that he doesn’t know what became of the Host beyond
the fact that he saw them dispatching it together with
a letter to the said Abenamias, as deponed, and that
all were present when this took place.</p>

<p>They seek to learn who was the instigator of the
affair, but Yuc&eacute; cannot answer with certainty on that
point. What he knows he tells them&mdash;that Tazarte
meeting him when he was on his way to Murcia, the
physician asked him would he join in a matter to be
performed with a consecrated wafer to ensure that the
Inquisition could not harm the Christians in question.
Before they met to crucify the boy, Tazarte told the
deponent and his brother Mos&eacute; that he had arranged
for it; and although Yuc&eacute; protests that he had no
inclination to have anything to do with the affair, he
and his brother allowed themselves in the end to be
persuaded to be present, and they went with Tazarte
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">326</span>
that same night to the cave. There they were
joined by the Christians, who brought the child with
them.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>So far, it will be seen, the evidence collected from
Yuc&eacute;’s fellow-prisoners, whilst admitting that he had
been present in the cave when the boy was crucified&mdash;an
admission in itself grave enough and quite sufficient
to procure his being abandoned to the secular arm&mdash;did
not charge him with any active participation in the
proceedings. In his own depositions Yuc&eacute; had insisted
that he and his father had been no more than spectators
and that they had gone to the cave more or less in
ignorance, as if hardly understanding what they were
to witness.</p>

<p>Moreover before relating the happenings in that
cave of Carre Oca&ntilde;a, Yuc&eacute; had made a sort of bargain
with the inquisitors that his confession should not be
used against himself or his father. And it is noteworthy
that the other Jews whom he incriminated were
all dead, and that he suppressed the name of the only
surviving Jew&mdash;Hernando de Ribera&mdash;who had taken
part in the affair. Of betraying the New-Christians
he would, as we have already said, have less concern, as
these by their apostasy must have become more or less
contemptible in the sight of a faithful Jew.</p>

<p>Whether the inquisitors conceived that in view of
his passivity in the matter, combined with the promise
they had made him before obtaining his confession,
they were not justified in proceeding to extremes with
him, we do not know. It is difficult to suppose any
such hesitation on their part. Whatever their object,
it is fairly clear that they did not account themselves
satisfied yet, and for the purpose of probing this matter
to the very bottom they now adopted a fresh method
of procedure which appears particularly to aim at the
further incrimination of Yuc&eacute;.</p>

<p>Just as the court was in the habit of suppressing
evidence entirely or in part, or the names of witnesses,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">327</span>
when this course best served its purposes, so, when
the depositions were obtained from co-accused, there
must obviously come a moment when the publication
of the evidence and of the witnesses by confrontation
must further the aims of the tribunal.</p>

<p>The anger aroused in each prisoner by the discovery
that his betrayer is one of his associates must spur
him to reprisals, and drive him to admit anything he
may hitherto have concealed. There is, of course,
the danger that he may be urged to embark upon
inventions to damage in his turn the man who has
destroyed him. But inquisitorial justice was not
deterred by any such consideration. Pegna&mdash;as we
have seen&mdash;tells us plainly enough that the point of
view of the Holy Office was that it was better that an
innocent man should perish than that a guilty one
should escape.</p>

<p>In pursuit of this policy, then, Benito Garcia is
brought before the inquisitors on October 12, and he
is asked whether in the matter of the crucifixion and
the Host he will repeat in the presence of any of the
participators in the crime what he has already deponed.
He replies in the affirmative. Thereupon he is taken
out. Yuc&eacute; Franco is introduced and asked the same
question with the same result. Benito is brought in
again, and, the two being confronted, each repeats in
the presence of the other the confession he has already
made.</p>

<p>They are now asked whether they will repeat these
statements once more, in the presence of Juan de
Oca&ntilde;a, and they announce themselves ready to do
so. They are removed. Oca&ntilde;a is introduced, and
having similarly obtained his agreement to repeat
before others whom he has accused of complicity what
he has already confessed, the inquisitors order the
other two to be brought back.</p>

<p>The notary records that they actually manifest
pleasure at seeing one another.</p>

<p>Oca&ntilde;a now repeats his confession, and Yuc&eacute; and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">328</span>
Benito again go over theirs. The three agree one
with the other, and it is now further elicited that
it was six months after the crucifixion, more or less,
when they assembled between Tenbleque and La
Guardia to give Benito the letter and the Host which
he was to convey to Abenamias in Zamora.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On October 17 there is another confrontation&mdash;of
Juan Franco with &Ccedil;a and Yuc&eacute; Franco. In this each
repeats what he has already confessed, which we now
learn for the first time. Juan Franco admits that it
was he himself who opened the boy’s side and took
out his heart, and in this as in other particulars the
depositions agree one with another.</p>

<p>Juan Franco goes on to say that they next met in
the cave some time after the crucifixion, and that his
brother Alonso brought the heart and the Host in a
box which he gave to Tazarte, who withdrew with
them to a corner of the cave to carry out his enchantments.
Later on they assembled between Tenbleque
and La Guardia&mdash;at a place which, according to this
witness, was called Sorrostros&mdash;and gave Benito a
letter to take to Zamora, this letter being tied with
a coloured thread.</p>

<p>So far he is completely in accord with the other
deponents; but now there occurs a startling discrepancy.
He says that at this last meeting (which,
we are told, took place some six months after the
crucifixion), in addition to the consecrated wafer and
the letter for Abenamias, they also gave Benito the
heart to take to Zamora.</p>

<p>Now all the other depositions lead us to suppose
that the heart and the first wafer were employed&mdash;presumably
consumed in some way&mdash;by Tazarte in
the enchantment performed at the first meeting after
the crucifixion, and that as doubts afterwards arose
touching the efficacy of the spells performed by the
physician, another Host was obtained some six months
later, which they forwarded to Zamora.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">329</span></p>

<p>Is the explanation the simple one that Juan Franco
is mistaken on the subject of the heart? It seems
possible, because he adds that he did not actually see
the Host (on this particular occasion), but that he
understood that it was given to Benito. Similarly he
may have understood&mdash;erroneously taking it for
granted&mdash;that the heart accompanied it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And now you may see the confrontation bearing
fruit, and yielding the results which we must suppose
are sought by the inquisitors&mdash;the further incrimination
of Yuc&eacute; Franco.</p>

<p>Juan de Oca&ntilde;a is examined again on October 20
and questioned as to Yuc&eacute;’s participation in the crime.
He now adds to his former confession that Yuc&eacute; and
the others used great vituperations to the child, which
vituperations were really aimed at Jesus Christ; he
cites the expressions, and in the main they are those
we have already quoted from the Testimonio<a id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">201</a>; these,
he says, were used by &Ccedil;a Franco and his two sons.
He says that they all whipped the boy, and that it was
Yuc&eacute; himself who drew blood from the arms of the
victim with a knife.</p>

<p>“Whence was the child?” they ask him.</p>

<p>He replies that it was the dead Jew Mos&eacute; Franco
who had brought the boy from Quintanar to Tenbleque
on a donkey, and that, according to Mos&eacute;’s
story, he was the son of Alonso Martin of Quintanar.<a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">202</a>
From Tenbleque several of them, amongst whom
were Yuc&eacute; and his father, brought him on the donkey
to the cave where he was crucified, and it was Yuc&eacute;
who went to summon the brothers Franco of La
Guardia, Benito Garcia, and the witness himself.</p>

<p>So that from having been a more or less passive
spectator of the scene, Yuc&eacute; is suddenly&mdash;by what we
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">330</span>
are justified in accounting the vindictiveness of Oca&ntilde;a&mdash;thrust
into the position of one of the chief actors,
indeed, almost one of the instigators of the crime.</p>

<p>On the same day Benito Garcia is re-examined.
His former depositions are read over to him, and he is
asked if he has anything to add to them. He has to
add, he finds, that Yuc&eacute;&mdash;whom he has hardly mentioned
hitherto&mdash;had whipped and struck the boy, and
that he was an active participant in all that was done,
his avowed aim being the destruction of Christianity,
which he spoke of as buffoonery and idolatry.</p>

<p>On the morrow Oca&ntilde;a is brought back to ratify his
statements of yesterday. He is asked if he has anything
to add that concerns the participation of Yuc&eacute;,
and his answer is so very much in the terms of the
latest additions made by Benito that one is left wondering
whether, departing from their usual custom,
the inquisitors put their questions in a precise and
definite form&mdash;founded upon what Benito has said&mdash;and
obtained affirmative replies from Oca&ntilde;a. For
Oca&ntilde;a, too, remembers that Yuc&eacute; said that Christianity
was all buffoonery and that Christians were idolaters.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">331</span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII<br />

<span class="medium">THE TRIAL OF YUC&Eacute; FRANCO&mdash;(<i>Concluded</i>)</span></h2>

<p>It might now be said that, thanks to the patient efforts
which the inquisitors themselves have been exerting
for close upon a year, the prosecutor is at last
furnished with the evidence necessary to support his
original charge against Yuc&eacute; Franco.</p>

<p>To this end he appears before the court on that
same October 21, 1491, to present in proof of his
denunciation the entire <i>dossier</i>, as taken down by the
notary of the tribunal. He begs that Yuc&eacute; be brought
into the audience-chamber to hear the additions which
he has to make to the original charge. These additions
are the matters lately extracted from Oca&ntilde;a
and Benito Garcia: that Yuc&eacute; used vituperative words
to the child when he was being crucified, and that
these vituperations were really aimed at our Lord
Jesus Christ and His Holy Catholic Faith; that he
struck the boy many times, and that he drew blood
from the boy’s arm with a penknife. Wherefore, he
begs the inquisitors to abandon the prisoner to the
secular arm, as is right and proper.<a id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">203</a></p>

<p>He does not, however, add that Yuc&eacute;’s brother
had procured the child, and that Yuc&eacute; was one of
those who brought him to the cave and who summoned
the Francos to attend&mdash;an omission which shows the
credit attached to Oca&ntilde;a’s statement and its lack of
corroboration.</p>

<p>Yuc&eacute;’s answer is a denial of all that is alleged and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">332</span>
added by the Fiscal, the lad protesting that he never
did or said anything beyond what he has, himself,
confessed.</p>

<p>Guev&aacute;ra, thereupon, petitions the court to permit
him to submit his proofs of the matters of which he
accuses the prisoner, and the court having accorded
him this petition, he puts in as evidence the entire
<i>dossier</i> from which we have drawn these pages on the
subject.<a id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">204</a></p>

<p>Five days later both parties are again before the
court, Guev&aacute;ra now petitioning their Reverend
Paternities to pass to the publication of witnesses,
that the trial may be brought to its conclusion.
Dr. Villada announces his readiness to do so, but
accords the defendants three days within which to
lodge any objection to any of the matter contained in
the depositions.</p>

<p>Yuc&eacute; begs through his advocate that copies be
given him of all the depositions of those who were
present at the crucifixion, with the name of each
hostile witness and a statement of the day, month,
year, and place in which anything alleged against him
is said to have taken place.</p>

<p>But Guev&aacute;ra immediately objects, urging that in
the copies of the depositions to be given defendant,
no names shall appear of any of the witnesses who
had deponed, and no circumstances shall be included
which might enable Yuc&eacute; to conjecture the names.
It seems a purely formal objection; for after the confrontations
there have been it appears to serve very
little purpose. But some purpose it does serve,
because those confrontations after all were limited
to Oca&ntilde;a and Benito, and from the moment that it
was not considered necessary to proceed to confrontation
with any of the other prisoners it would seem
that they had needed no such spur to drive them into
depositions hostile to Yuc&eacute;.</p>

<p>However, the reverend inquisitor replies loftily
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">333</span>
enough that he will do what justice demands, and he
orders the notary to deliver to Yuc&eacute; copies of all the
depositions against him. But from Yuc&eacute;’s advocate’s
plea on October 29&mdash;upon the expiry of the three days
appointed&mdash;it is plain that the particulars claimed have
been withheld.</p>

<p>From the fact that the advocate San&ccedil; has drawn
up so strong an objection on behalf of his client, it is
perfectly clear that even at this date Yuc&eacute;’s guilt of
heresy cannot be considered as established. If that
were the case, San&ccedil;, in obedience to the oath imposed
upon him when entrusted with the defence, would
have been compelled to lay down his brief and
withdraw.</p>

<p>Yuc&eacute; denies all the allegations against him which
charge him with having taken any active part in the
crucifixion of the boy, and he protests that he is
unable properly to defend himself because the copies
of the depositions supplied him do not mention time
or place of the alleged offences nor yet the names of
the witnesses by whom these allegations are made.
Upon the assumption, however, that these deponents
are Benito Garcia, Juan Franco, and Juan de Oca&ntilde;a,
he proceeds to answer the charges as best he can.</p>

<p>This answer consists of a repudiation of those
depositions as inadmissible upon the grounds that
they do not agree one with another, and that each
refers to a separate circumstance, no two confirming
any one particular accusation, and all being contrary
to what the same witnesses had stated in confrontation
with the defendant, when each had acknowledged
that Yuc&eacute;’s relation of the events was the true one.
Hence it is established that on one or the other of
these occasions they must have lied, from which it
follows that they are perjured and unworthy of faith.</p>

<p>Further, he claims that they may not be admitted
as witnesses because they were, themselves, participators
in the crime committed. Finally, he declares
that their implication of himself is an act of spite and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">334</span>
vengeance upon him. It is his full and faithful confession
which has placed the inquisitors in possession
of the facts of the case and the names of the offenders,
and the latter are determined that since they themselves
must die, Yuc&eacute; shall die with them&mdash;out of
which malice and enmity they have accused him.</p>

<p>Upon these grounds, and insisting that he has told
them the utter and complete truth, and that he himself
was no more than a witness of the events, and in no
way a participator, Yuc&eacute; bases his defence, and begs
that the depositions should cease to weigh against him.<a id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">205</a></p>

<p>Guev&aacute;ra’s answer, if it inclines to the grotesque, is
quite typical, and is certainly more to the taste of the
court.</p>

<p>He denies that the witnesses are inspired by any
such animosity as Yuc&eacute; suggests, and he asserts that
they have deponed “with devout zeal of faith, and to
deliver their souls from peril.” And amongst these,
be it remembered, was Benito Garcia, who conceived
that the worst thing he had ever done in his life had
been to get himself baptized a Christian, and who continued
firm in his resolve to die a Jew at all costs. Only
at the very stake itself&mdash;as we shall see&mdash;did he recant
again, that he might earn the mercy of strangulation.
Yet Guev&aacute;ra does not hesitate to say&mdash;what he must
know to be untrue&mdash;that these men have confessed
“with devout zeal of faith.”</p>

<p>On these grounds Guev&aacute;ra urges that the depositions
must be admitted as made in good faith and
as proof; and since the said Yuc&eacute; Franco would not
spontaneously confess all that he had done, their
Reverend Paternities should put him to the question
of torture, as by law prescribed in such circumstances as
the present.<a id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">206</a></p>

<p>The court agrees with its Fiscal and proceeds to
draw up a list of fifteen questions to be put to the
accused.<a id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">207</a></p>

<p>With this list the inquisitors Villada and Santo
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">335</span>
Domingo, accompanied by their notary, go down into
the prisons of the Inquisition on November 2, and
order Yuc&eacute; Franco to be brought before them.</p>

<p>“Very lovingly and humanely” they admonish
him to tell the whole truth of the things known to
him that are the business of the Holy Office, and
particularly in answer to the questions they have prepared.
These questions being summed up amount to
the following: Whence was the child that was crucified?
Whose child was it? Who brought it to the
cave? Who first set on foot this affair?</p>

<p>They promise him that if he makes truthful answer
they will use him as mercifully as the law and their
consciences permit.</p>

<p>Yuc&eacute; has cause to mistrust any such promises.
His first confession was made three months ago under
a promise of pardon, and he has every reason to
suppose that it has been the ruin of him.</p>

<p>He says, however, that being in the cave on the
occasion when they foregathered there for the enchantment&mdash;about
fourteen days after the crucifixion&mdash;he
heard Tazarte inquire whence was the child, and Juan
Franco replied before all that it was from a place
whence it would never be missed, “as stated in his
confession.”</p>

<p>(When last asked this question&mdash;at the time of
making his confession&mdash;he had attributed these words
to Tazarte.)</p>

<p>He protests that he can remember no more than
he has already confessed.</p>

<p>Their Reverend Paternities deplore his stubbornness.
They tell him that since he will not speak the
entire truth of what he knows&mdash;as they have proof&mdash;they
must proceed to other measures. They summon
Diego Martin, the torturer, and into his hands they
deliver the prisoner, with orders to take him to the
torture-chamber, strip him naked, and bind him to
the <i>escalera</i>&mdash;intending, if necessary, to proceed to the
water-torture.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">336</span></p>

<p>This is done, and Yuc&eacute; is stretched naked and
cruelly bound with ropes that bite into his flesh as
a foretaste of the <i>garrote</i> by which his torments will
commence. The inquisitors enter&mdash;possibly after a
delay sufficient to allow the mental torture of anticipation
to terrorize the patient into a more amenable
frame of mind.</p>

<p>Again they admonish him for his own sake to
speak what he knows, and they even point out to him
that it is his duty as a God-fearing Jew to speak the
truth. Again they promise to deal mercifully with
him if he will answer their questions fully and truthfully;
and lastly they protest that if his blood is shed
in the course of what is to follow, or should he suffer
any other harm, or mutilation of limb, or even death,
the blame must fall entirely upon himself and nowise
upon their reverences.</p>

<p>Fully intimidated by this skilful accumulation of
terrorizing agents, Yuc&eacute; implores them to repeat their
questions, which he will do his best to answer.</p>

<p>“Whence,” they ask him again, “was the boy who
was crucified at La Guardia?”</p>

<p>“Juan Franco,” he replies, “brought him from
Toledo.” He adds that Juan Franco announced this
before them all, and told them that he had kept the
child concealed in La Hos de La Guardia for a day
before bringing him to the cave to be crucified.</p>

<div id="i_336" class="figcenter">

<p class="small"><i>Photo by Donald Macbeth.</i></p>

<p class="caption">SANBENITO OF PENITENT RELAPSED.<br />
From Limborch’s ‘Historia Inquisitionis.’</p>
</div>

<p>What is not to be explained is why Yuc&eacute; should
have waited until he was strapped to the <i>escalera</i> before
making this statement. Why did he not make it when
the question was asked him at his last examination&mdash;if
not in his original confession? It cannot be pretended
that he was endeavouring to screen Juan
Franco, because he has very amply betrayed him in
other ways. Is the explanation that under fear of
torture he felt the need to invent an answer likely to
satisfy the inquisitors? It can hardly be that, because
Juan Franco himself is to admit&mdash;as we shall see&mdash;the
truth of this detail. It only remains to be supposed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">337</span>
that the lively fear of torture had sharpened the young
Jew’s memory. But that again seems hardly satisfactory
as an explanation.</p>

<p>“Where,” they ask him next, “is La Hos?”</p>

<p>“It is,” he replies, “a meadow by the River
Algodor,” and he goes on to explain that Juan Franco
had told them all that he had taken a load of wheat to
Toledo to sell, and that, having sold it, he went to an
inn, and later on he found the boy in a doorway and
coaxed him away with <i>nu&eacute;gados</i> (a sweetmeat composed
of flour, honey, and nuts&mdash;nougat). Thus he
got him into his cart and brought him to La Guardia.</p>

<p>Yuc&eacute; doesn’t know who were the child’s parents,
nor in what street of Toledo he was taken by Juan
Franco, as the latter did not mention those particulars.</p>

<p>“Who were the first to propose the affair? Did
the Jews engage the Christians in it, or the Christians
engage the Jews?”</p>

<p>He answers that the Francos of La Guardia,
fearing the Inquisition, performed an enchantment
in the first instance with a consecrated wafer, as
he has already confessed (October 11), and then
repaired to Tazarte asking him to do something
more efficacious, as the sorcery with the wafer had
had no result. Tazarte agreed, and bade them procure
a Christian boy for the purpose. When Juan
Franco brought him, it was decided to cut out his
heart, that with this heart and a wafer a stronger
enchantment might be performed.</p>

<p>“Why was he done to death by crucifixion rather
than in any other way?”</p>

<p>Yuc&eacute; believes that the crucifixion was preferred in
vituperation of Jesus Christ. But again he protests
that his own share was no more than he has confessed
already.</p>

<p>“What were the particular vituperations used to
the child, and by whom?”</p>

<p>His answer to this question incriminates all those
who were present at the affair; the vituperations
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">338</span>
which he tells the inquisitors were employed were
rather indecent, and include a scurrilous version of
the Incarnation which would, no doubt, be current
at the time among Jews and other enemies of
Christianity in Spain and elsewhere&mdash;a story, it is
needless to add, entirely idle and foolish, and rather
the obvious thing to be conceived in those days against
any historical character who might be detested.</p>

<p>He says that Tazarte was the leader in all the
vituperations (which sounds likely enough, as Tazarte
was the celebrant), that the others uttered them after
him, and he admits that he himself said some of the
things which he has mentioned, but he doesn’t enter
into particulars.</p>

<p>“For what purpose were the heart and the Host
required, and what good purpose was expected to be
served by these sorceries?”</p>

<p>He replies that these things were done to the end
that the inquisitors or any others who should aim at
molesting these Christians concerned should die of
rabies.</p>

<p>“What advantage did the Jews look to gain?”</p>

<p>He states that Tazarte had assured them that as
a consequence of the enchantment all Christians in
the land must either perish or become Jews, so that
the Law of Moses should triumph and prevail.</p>

<p>“To whom were the heart and the Host to be
delivered for the said enchantment?”</p>

<p>“To Mos&eacute; Abenamias at Zamora.”</p>

<p>“Was Abenamias himself to perform the enchantment?”</p>

<p>“No; he was to give orders for its performance to
a wizard of Zamora.”</p>

<p>“Does he, or do any of the others, know the said
wizard, and what is his name?”</p>

<p>He cannot answer the question, beyond telling them
that he had heard Tazarte say that he knew Abenamias
and the wizard, and that he had been to school with
the latter.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">339</span></p>

<p>“How many times did they assemble to decide
upon the crucifixion?”</p>

<p>He knows that all (with the exception of himself)
assembled in the same cave to perform an enchantment
with a Host on an occasion previous to that of
the boy’s crucifixion. He knows this because he was
invited to the gathering; he did not wish to go, and
so stayed away, but he was told afterwards by the
others what had been done.</p>

<p>“What Christians does he know to have kept the
Sabbath, the Passover, and to have performed Jewish
rites?”</p>

<p>He says that Benito once came to their house at
Tenbleque and spent a Sabbath with them, doing no
work, eating <i>adafinas</i> and drinking <i>Caser</i> wine; and
that he came upon another occasion and asked them
when was the fast of <i>Tisabeaf</i> (the eve of Purim), and
that he believes that, being informed of this, he kept
that fast.</p>

<p>He can remember no others, excepting one Diego
de Ayllon and three of his daughters and a son, all
of whom kept the Sabbath and observed the law of
Moses in secret; and the widow of one Juan de
Origuela, deceased, who sometimes kept Jewish fasts;
and Juan Vermejo of Tenbleque, whom he knows
once to have kept the great fast.</p>

<p>These names are duly noted on the margin of the
notary’s document as matters of importance which
need inquiring into.</p>

<p>“Whence was the wafer procured, and how does
he know that it was consecrated?”</p>

<p>He answers that when they assembled, a fortnight
after the crucifixion, he heard Alonso Franco say that
he had taken it from the monstrance in the Church
of Romeral, replacing it by an unconsecrated wafer.</p>

<p>“Was this the wafer given to Tazarte with the
heart?”</p>

<p>He believes so, but he is not sure, nor does he
know what became of it.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">340</span></p>

<p>“Who brought the other wafer given to Benito,
and whence was it obtained?”</p>

<p>Alonso brought it, and said that he had obtained
it in the church of La Guardia, and that it was
consecrated. But Yuc&eacute; doesn’t know if anyone gave
it to him.<a id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">208</a></p>

<p>This confession Yuc&eacute; ratified two days later, adding
now that Juan and Garcia Franco together had brought
the boy, and that one had remained at La Hos with
him whilst the other had come to La Guardia.
Further, he adds that the letter to Abenamias at
Zamora bore six signatures&mdash;Tazarte’s, Alonso Franco’s,
Benito Garcia’s, Yuc&eacute; Franco’s own, his brother’s, and
one other which he can’t recall.<a id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">209</a></p>

<p>We have already indicated that a mystery attaches
to this letter. What has become of it? We are told
that Benito bore it together with the Host. How
does it happen that it was not taken together with the
Host when he was arrested at the inn at Astorga?
Possibly it was. But in that case, and since it bore
Yuc&eacute;’s signature, why is it not included in the <i>dossier</i>,
and why can we find no trace of any use having been
made of it by the inquisitors? The only plausible
explanation&mdash;and it may be forthcoming when the
<i>dossiers</i> of the other accused are discovered&mdash;is that
the Host found upon Benito Garcia was not the one
sent with the letter by his hand some time in 1487
or 1488.</p>

<p>On November 3 the octogenarian &Ccedil;a is examined
in the torture-chamber, strapped, as was his son, to
the <i>escalera</i>. But the mere fear of torture is not
sufficient to loosen the tongue of this aged Jew. He
resists their questions, and will add nothing to what
he has confessed, until the executioner has submitted
him to that frightful torment and given him one jar of
water. He then affords them, at last, the further
information they require, telling them the precise
vituperations that were addressed to the crucified boy,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">341</span>
and admitting that this was done in mockery of the
Passion of Jesus Christ. He says that Tazarte
uttered the insults, and that the others&mdash;first the
Jews, and after them the Christians&mdash;repeated them.
Further, he confesses that the child was crucified and
the sorceries performed that the inquisitors and all
Christians should enrage and die.<a id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">210</a></p>

<p>On the same day Juan Franco was tied to the
<i>escalera</i>, beyond which it was not necessary to proceed
with him, for he there satisfied the inquisitors by
confessing to the vituperations employed against the
crucified boy.<a id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">211</a></p>

<p>On the 4th further confirmation of this is obtained
from Juan de Oca&ntilde;a, who confesses to the vituperations,
and says that they were first uttered by the
Jews, who then compelled the Christians to repeat
them. He does not remember the terms used, nor
would he ever have known them but for the Jews.<a id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">212</a></p>

<p>Benito is next examined, and warned by the inquisitors
to answer truthfully, as the truth is already
fully known to them. He admits that many vituperations
were used; he cites them, and in the main
they agree with what has already been deponed.</p>

<p>“Who,” he is asked, “were the first to utter these
things?”</p>

<p>He replies that &Ccedil;a Franco, his sons, and Tazarte
(<i>i.e.</i> the Jews) were the first, and that he and the
other Christians repeated them afterwards.</p>

<p>Lastly, on November 5, Alonso Franco affords
the fullest confirmation to all this that has been
confessed by the other accused.<a id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">213</a></p>

<p>The trial is now rapidly drawing to a close. On
the 7th Yuc&eacute; is again before the court, and&mdash;sinister
feature&mdash;this time he comes alone. His counsel has
vanished, in acknowledgment of the fact that it is
no longer tenable with his duty to God that he should
continue to defend one of whose “heresy” he is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">342</span>
himself convinced. Yuc&eacute; himself, in view of this,
must realize that he is lost, and must abandon his
last shred of hope.</p>

<p>Guev&aacute;ra, the prosecutor, is there, and Dr. Villada
announces that additional proof is now before the
court. He orders copies of the latest depositions,
obtained in the torture-chamber, to be delivered to
the defendant, and he accords the latter three days
within which he must lodge any objection to anything
contained in them.</p>

<p>But Yuc&eacute; does not require so long. He realizes
that all is lost, and he forthwith confesses that what
has been deponed by the witnesses against him concerning
the vituperations he used is true with certain
exceptions, and these were the most blasphemous and
insulting.</p>

<p>Upon that the fiscal Guev&aacute;ra formally petitions
the court to pass sentence. The inquisitor Santo
Domingo declares the trial to be at an end, and
dismisses both parties, requiring them to come before
the court again in three days’ time to hear the
sentence.<a id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">214</a></p>

<p>Yet, before proceeding to this, on the 14th day
of that month of November, the inquisitors ordered
all the prisoners (with the exception of Juan Franco)
to be introduced together into the audience-chamber.
There, in the presence of his co-accused, each was
bidden to recite what he had already confessed, this
being done with the aim of obtaining a greater
unanimity upon details.</p>

<p>Last of all, Juan Franco is brought in, and he
now admits that it is true that he brought the boy from
Toledo, that they had crucified him as he has confessed,
that he himself had opened the boy’s side and
taken out his heart, and that his brother Alonso had
opened the veins of the child’s arms, etc.&mdash;all as
confessed&mdash;and further that it is true that he and his
brother Alfonso had afterwards buried their victim.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">343</span></p>

<p>He now corroborates Benito’s statement that on
the day they stole the child he and Benito went together
to Toledo, and that they agreed that one
should seek in one quarter of the city whilst the
other sought in another. And further, he says that
he found the child in the doorway&mdash;known as the
Puerta del Perdon&mdash;of the cathedral, as he has already
stated in his confession (which is not before us).<a id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">215</a></p>

<p>On the next day Guev&aacute;ra appears before the inquisitors
to petition that in view of what has been deponed
against the deceased Mos&eacute; Franco, Yuc&eacute; Tazarte, and
David Perejon, their Paternities should order it to be
recorded <i>ad perpetuam rei memoriam</i>, to enable the
execution of the deceased in effigy, the confiscation of
their property, and the infamy of their heirs.</p>

<p>That is on November 15. On the 16th the last
scene of this protracted trial is played in the market-square
of Avila.</p>

<p>There, near the church of St. Peter, the scaffolds
have been erected for the Auto de F&eacute;. On one, in
their hideous yellow <i>sanbenitos</i>, are grouped the eight
prisoners and the three effigies. On the other are
the inquisitors, Dr. Pedro de Villada and Frey Antonio
de Santo Domingo, with all the <i>personnel</i> of the Holy
Office, their notaries, the fiscal Guev&aacute;ra, familiars, and
apparitors. Round the scaffolds thronged the greater
part of the inhabitants of Avila and many who had
come in from the surrounding country districts, whence
it is clear that the Auto had been announced some
days before. The popular feeling against the Jews
runs high, and it is an angry, turbulent mob that
witnesses the Auto. Avila, indeed, is in uproar, and
no Jew dare show himself abroad without risk of
being insulted or assaulted in the street.<a id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">216</a></p>

<p>The sentences are read by the notary Antonio
Gon&ccedil;ales, commencing with a very full narrative of
the crimes of each of the accused, which we need not
render here as it is a summary of all that has been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">344</span>
gone through and practically a repetition of the matter
contained in the “Testimonio.”</p>

<p>They are sentenced all to be abandoned to the
secular arm of the Corregidor Don Alvaro de Sant’
Estiban, who, advised some days before, is in attendance
with his lieutenants and <i>alguaziles</i>.</p>

<p>The usual exhortation being duly pronounced, they
are seized by the men of the Corregidor and led away
out of the city to the burning-place. The inquisitors
order their notaries to accompany the doomed men,
that they may record their final confessions at the
stake.</p>

<p>In Yuc&eacute;’s <i>dossier</i> are included not only his own confession&mdash;made
at the last moment&mdash;but also Benito
Garcia’s, Juan de Oca&ntilde;a’s, and Juan Franco’s, all
recorded by the notary Gon&ccedil;ales. Further, this <i>dossier</i>
contains a letter written on the morrow of the event
by the same notary of the Holy Office to the authorities
of La Guardia, accompanying a relation of the
crime and the sentences pronounced, for publication in
La Guardia, where the offences were committed.</p>

<p>From this we learn that Benito, in spite of his
protestations that he would die a Jew betide what might,
accepted at the stake the spiritual comforts of the
Church, and thus earned the mercy of being strangled
before the faggots were fired.<a id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">217</a></p>

<p>Similarly Juan de Oca&ntilde;a and Juan Franco accepted
the ministrations of the attendant friars and returned
to the Church from which they had secretly seceded.
But the Jews&mdash;the stalwart old man of over eighty
and his son&mdash;held staunchly to their faith, and refused
to avoid by apostasy any part of the agony prepared
them. Wherefore, in a spite that seems almost satanic,
their flesh was torn with red-hot pincers before they
were consumed over slow fires.</p>

<p>“They refused,” writes the reverend notary, “to
call upon God or the Virgin Mary or to make so
much as a sign of the Cross. Do not pray for them,”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">345</span>
he concludes, impatiently it seems to us, “for they are
buried in Hell.”</p>

<p>Finally, the notary begs the authorities of La
Guardia not to permit that the place where Juan
Franco said that the Holy Child was buried should be
ploughed over, but to see that it is left intact.
Their Highnesses and the Cardinal of Spain, he adds,
may desire to visit it, and he prays that God “may
reveal to us the bones of the infant.” It is expedient
to mark the spot, he concludes, because, in view of the
merits of such a place, he hopes that it may please God
that the earth of it will work miracles.</p>

<p>The sentence is sent, it should be added, with
order that it shall be read from the pulpit of La
Guardia on the following Sunday, and this under pain
of excommunication.</p>

<p>In Avila the popular feeling against the Jews as a
consequence of this affair was so bitter that their lives
were not safe, and it is on record that one was stoned
to death in the streets. It became necessary for the
Aljama of that city to petition the Sovereigns for
protection, and M. Fidel Fita quotes a royal letter commanding
such protection to be extended, with threats
of rigour against any who should molest them.<a id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">218</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">346</span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV<br />

<span class="medium">EPILOGUE TO THE AFFAIR OF THE SANTO NI&Ntilde;O</span></h2>

<p>The evidence given by Yuc&eacute; Franco as to whence
the consecrated wafers had been obtained is hearsay
evidence, and very vague even then. But it would
appear that from Benito Garcia or Alfonso Franco the
inquisitors have been able to obtain something more
definite, for whilst the trial of the eight accused has
been drawing to a close, the familiars of the Holy
Office have been about the apprehension of the
sacristan of the church of La Guardia.</p>

<p>On November 18, 1491&mdash;two days after the Auto&mdash;this
sacristan is brought before the court at Avila,
and admonished to tell the truth of this matter, being
promised mercy if he will do so.</p>

<p>He states that about two years ago his uncle,
Alonso Franco, besought him on two separate occasions
to let him have two consecrated wafers,
promising him a cloak and money and much else
if he would so. Ultimately, in response to these
requests, and in accordance with the instructions he
received from Alonso, he delivered a consecrated
wafer to Benito Garcia, who came for it on the other’s
behalf.</p>

<p>He remembers that it was winter-time, but he
cannot recall the day or even the month. He explains
that he took the Host from the pyx in the sanctuary
of the Church of Santa Maria, having obtained the
keys from the earthenware pot in which they were
kept. He says that he begged Benito to tell him
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">347</span>
what it was wanted for, but that he could not induce
him to say. He was assured, however, that no harm
was intended.</p>

<p>He is able to fix the date more closely by remembering
that the Francos were arrested about five
months later.</p>

<p>Under further examination he declares that he
believes in the True Presence, and always did, and
that when he urged this upon Alfonso Franco and
Benito Garcia they admitted that his act was a sin,
but they assured him that it was not a heresy, and that
no heresy was involved, and that for the sin his
confessor would absolve him.<a id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">219</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>One man who is alleged to have had a share in
the affair of La Guardia escaped all mention at the
time in the depositions of the accused, and was,
consequently, entirely overlooked. This was one
Hernando de Ribera, a man of a station in life very
much above that of the others, and it is said that in
consequence of this to him had been assigned the
aristocratic role of Pilate in that parody of the
Passion.</p>

<p>Not until nearly thirty years later was he arrested,
self-betrayed, it is said, the man having boasted of
his share in that affair. He was convicted of that
crime, and also of flagrant Judaizing, for in the meanwhile
he had accepted baptism to avoid expulsion
from Spain when the decree of banishment of all
Jews was published.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Now, whilst the publication by M. Fidel Fita of
the records of the trial of Yuc&eacute; Franco has shed a
good deal of light upon the affair, it is not to be denied
that much still remains to be explained, and that until
such explanations are forthcoming&mdash;until the records
of the proceedings against Yuc&eacute;’s co-accused are
brought to light and we are able to compare them
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">348</span>
one with another&mdash;the affair of the Holy Infant of
La Guardia must to a certain extent continue in the
category of historic mysteries.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, however, in spite of the glaring contradictions
contained in the evidence at present
available, in spite of the incongruities which refuse
to fit into the general scheme, we cannot hold that
M. Loeb is justified of his conclusion that the Holy
Infant of La Guardia&mdash;and consequently the crime
with which we have dealt&mdash;never had any real
existence.<a id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">220</a></p>

<p>M. Loeb makes a twofold contention:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(<i>a</i>) If the crime of La Guardia ever did take
place, then upon the evidence itself, it was not
ritual murder at all, but a case of sorcery in which
Christians were concerned as well as Jews.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) No such crime ever did take place.</p></blockquote>

<p>He bases his somewhat daring final conclusion
upon three premises:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(<i>a</i>) The depositions of the witnesses, obtained
under torture or the threat of it, are full of contradictions,
of improbabilities, and of facts materially
impossible.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The judges made no inquest to discover
the truth.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) The Inquisition is unable to fix the date of
the crime; it did not verify the disappearance or
discover the remains of any child.</p></blockquote>

<p>The first of these premises is the most worthy of
attention. The other two appear to us to overlook
the fact that our present knowledge is confined to the
record of the trial of one of the accused, and this one a
youth who was guilty of participating in the crime in a
comparatively minor degree.</p>

<p>No one is in a position to say that the judges made
no inquest to discover the truth. All that we know is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">349</span>
that it does not transpire from Yuc&eacute;’s trial that any
such efforts were made. But then such efforts may
not so much concern Yuc&eacute;’s trial as the trials of some
of the ringleaders, and it is very possible that the
records of the latter may divulge some such inquest.
It is more than possible. The compiler of the r&eacute;sum&eacute;
of seven of the trials distinctly shows that this was
done.<a id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">221</a> He cites the fact that when Juan Franco had
confessed that he and his brother Alonso buried the
boy, the inquisitors took him to the place where he
stated that the body had been inhumed, and made him
point out the exact spot, “and they discovered the
truth and demonstration of all this.”<a id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">222</a></p>

<p>This, of course, does not mean that the body was
found. It simply means&mdash;as we are told&mdash;that the
place indicated by Juan Franco presented the appearance
of having lately served the purpose of a grave.
The failure to find the body is undoubtedly one of the
unexplained mysteries of this affair. But it does not
justify the statement that no inquest was made&mdash;a
statement which in itself implies that the inquisitors
knew the whole story to be false, and therefore
deliberately avoided inquiries which should expose
that falseness.</p>

<p>The vagueness and confusion that appear to exist
on the subject of the date when the crime was
committed certainly call for comment.</p>

<p>The contradictions on this score appear to be
flagrant, and it is impossible to reconcile the date
of the crucifixion with that of Benito Garcia’s arrest
in Astorga. It seems to be established by Yuc&eacute; that
the crucifixion took place at the end of Lent 1488;
and he and others tell us that about six months later
they all assembled again to dispatch the Host to
Zamora by the hand of Benito. Yet Benito is
arrested in Astorga in May or June of 1490&mdash;more
than eighteen months after setting out for Zamora&mdash;and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">350</span>
the wafer is still in his possession, undelivered.
That is what <i>seems</i> to be established. But it is
possible that a very simple explanation may dispose
of this discrepancy. We are not justified by our
present knowledge in saying that the inquisitors were
unable to dispose of it. We may not assume that
there is not, in the records of the trials of the other
accused, matter that will clear up this question.</p>

<p>The date supplied by the sacristan, for instance,
does not seem to be so very inconsistent with that
of the event in the inn at Astorga. He said, it will
be remembered, that he had delivered the wafer to
Benito some five months before the arrest of the
Francos. This tends strongly to confirm the impression
we have already formed that the wafer
discovered upon Benito at the time of his arrest
was not the one that he had set out to take to
Zamora some two years earlier. The Host, together
with the letter for Abenamias, may very well have
reached its destination. If this is admitted&mdash;and
there is nothing in the evidence to forbid its admittance&mdash;much
that is irreconcilable in the depositions
at once disappears.</p>

<p>M. Loeb, of course, has proceeded upon the
assumption that it is pretended that the Host dispatched
from La Guardia in 1488 and the Host
found upon Benito at Astorga in 1490 are one and
the same. It may appear to be the obvious thing
to assume. Yet it is a hasty assumption, which
nothing in the evidence before us will justify.</p>

<p>As for the other discrepancies which M. Loeb
points out, when all is said, they refer to matters of
detail, upon which mistakes are not impossible.</p>

<p>Benito states that the child’s hands and feet were
nailed to the cross in addition to being tied, whilst
Yuc&eacute; makes no mention of nails.</p>

<p>According to the statements of Yuc&eacute; and of Juan
Franco, it is the latter’s brother who opened the veins
in the boy’s arms, whereas Oca&ntilde;a said that this was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">351</span>
done by Yuc&eacute;. We have already drawn attention to
the circumstances under which Oca&ntilde;a so accused
Yuc&eacute;, and we have suggested the vindictiveness that
may have inspired him.</p>

<p>Juan Franco confessed that he himself cut open
the boy’s side and drew out the heart, whilst Yuc&eacute;’s
statement was to the effect that Juan had opened the
wound and Garcia Franco had torn out the heart.</p>

<p>Mainly the evidence seems to say that the child
bled to death. Yet Benito states that he was strangled(?),
and Yuc&eacute; in one of his statements says that
they gagged him because he was crying. We have
already suggested that by the expression “<i>lo ahogaron</i>”
so much as “strangling” may not necessarily
have been meant.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>These are, after all, the principal discrepancies;
and it is to be remembered that these men were
referring to things done at least two years before;
that confusion on the score of particulars is not
only possible but more or less inevitable; and that,
despite contradictions in these details, the main facts
stated are always the same in the depositions of each.
M. Loeb more than suggests that this unanimity was
contrived by the inquisitors. He puts it forward as
more than probable that the prisoners were left alone
together on the occasions of the confrontations, to the
end that they might agree upon the same tale.</p>

<p>There is not the slightest warrant for such an
assumption. In the records the notary very clearly
states that the inquisitors were present throughout
those confrontations, and it is of importance to remember
that these records were not prepared for
publication, but were to be consigned to the secret
archives of the Inquisition&mdash;so that any notion of a
fraud having been deliberately perpetrated may once
for all be dismissed as entirely idle.</p>

<p>But even were it not the recorded fact that the
inquisitors were present at the confrontations, and that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">352</span>
the prisoners were afforded no opportunity of coming
to any understanding, it would still be extremely
difficult to believe that they should have come to
an understanding to get themselves all burnt.</p>

<p>M. Loeb’s attempt to make this appear reasonable
is the least convincing thing in a very able but quite
unconvincing article. It certainly seems to display
his own want of confidence in the general acceptance
of such a situation.</p>

<p>“We could understand,” he says, “that guilty men
should come to an understanding to deny the crime
committed, or to attenuate the fault, or to cast it upon
others. But what should be the meaning of an understanding
whose object, as would be the case here, is to
make truthful avowals of a real crime? The accused
would be taking unnecessary trouble. But all is
explained if, on the contrary, they prepared confessions
of a crime that was never committed.”</p>

<p>M. Loeb has vitiated his argument by the absolute
assumption that an understanding did take place.
This we cannot admit upon the evidence before us.
But if we do, is the position materially altered?
M. Loeb says that “all is explained if they prepared
confessions of a crime that was never committed.”
To our mind, nothing is explained by such a procedure.
What possible object could have induced them to come
to an understanding to make an uncommitted crime
the subject of a unanimous confession that must
infallibly send them to the stake? What possible
advantage could they hope to derive from a falsehood
of that description?</p>

<p>One of the chief obstacles to the rejection of the
story as a fabrication is Yuc&eacute;’s confession to “the Rabbi
Abraham” in the prison of Segovia. M. Loeb recognizes
it, and although he makes a determined attempt
to overcome it, his arguments are too arbitrary and
do not materially affect the point even if they are
admitted.</p>

<p>But if M. Loeb is entirely unconvincing in his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">353</span>
attempts to prove that the crucifixion of the boy is a
fable, nothing could be more convincing than his first
contention: that even if we account the story true
as contained in Yuc&eacute;’s <i>dossier</i>, the deed is not to be
looked upon as ritual murder, but purely as an operation
in magic.</p>

<p>It is a conclusion with which you must come to
agree, although at first glance you may be tempted to
form the opinion that the crucifixion of the child served
both purposes. Some such opinion had been formed
by the inquisitors when they asked why the boy had
been crucified rather than put to death in some other
fashion, since his heart was all that was required for
the enchantment.</p>

<p>The answer was that crucifixion was chosen in
derision and vituperation of the Passion of Jesus
Christ. But this is a very different thing from ritual
murder or “the hanging of Haman.” If we turn to
the actual vituperative phrases employed,<a id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">223</a> we find the
expression of a desire to wound the Redeemer Himself,
through that form of magic, common in all ages,
known as <i>envo&ucirc;tement</i>. Instead of the waxen or
wooden effigy usually employed, a living body is used
in this case. For the rest the immolation of a child
plays its part in the magic ritual of other than Jews.
We need mention but the notorious instance of the
Black Masses celebrated by the infamous Abb&eacute;
Gribourg in the eighteenth century.</p>

<p>There seems, indeed, no doubt at all that we are
justified in rejecting the theory that the crucifixion of
the Holy Child of La Guardia is to be accepted as an
instance of Jewish ritual murder. So far we can
accompany M. Loeb, but no farther. We cannot say
with him that no such crime was ever committed. To
convince us of that it would be necessary to show that
the whole of the <i>dossier</i> we have considered is a forgery
to serve the purposes of Torquemada. And this we
have proof that it is not. Had it been that, had it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">354</span>
been manufactured for popular consumption, it would
not have lain concealed for four centuries in the secret
archives of the Inquisition.</p>

<p>That Torquemada exploited the matter and turned
it to the fullest account is admitted. But this merely
shows him to be an opportunist; it is very far from
proving him a forger. The very sentence was couched
in terms calculated to excite&mdash;as it did&mdash;popular indignation
against the Jews. Nor did the publication
of the sentence end in La Guardia, whither copies
were sent. We may infer that Torquemada scattered
those copies broadcast through Spain, since we actually
find a Catalan translation which was specially prepared
for publication in Barcelona.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The cult of the Holy Child of La Guardia sprang
up at once, and developed rapidly. Numerous shrines
were set up in his honour, the first and chief of these
being on the site of the house of Juan Franco, which
had been razed to the ground. Here an altar was
erected in the cellar of the house, on the spot where
it was believed that the child’s sufferings had begun; it
was surmounted by a figure of a child pinioned to a
column.</p>

<p>Over this subterranean shrine a church sprang
rapidly into existence.</p>

<p>Another hermitage was erected near Santa Maria
de Pera, on the spot where the child was alleged to
have been buried, and yet another in the cave where
he was believed to have suffered crucifixion. “In all
times since,” says Moreno,<a id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">224</a> “the three sanctuaries have
been frequented by those who come to pray to the
Ni&ntilde;o as to a saint.”</p>

<p>The first of these sanctuaries was erected by 1501&mdash;at
which date records of it are to be found. It was called
the Sanctuary of the Holy Innocent, and Moreno adds
that this has always received the approval of Popes
and Bishops, and that plenary and partial indulgences
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">355</span>
have been granted to the faithful visiting these
shrines.</p>

<p>The people of La Guardia elected him their patron
saint, and a fast was appointed for the eve of his feast-day,
which at first was March 25, but was afterwards
changed to September 25. Moreno includes in his
book the prayers prescribed and a litany to the Ni&ntilde;o.<a id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">225</a></p>

<p>But it is not without a certain significance that
Rome&mdash;ever cautious, as we have already had occasion
to say, in the matter of canonization&mdash;has not yet
recognized the Holy Child of La Guardia as one of
the saints of the Church.</p>

<p>Yepes chronicles four miracles performed by the
child after his death, beginning with his mother’s
obtaining sight. All these, with other very interesting
and purely romantic details, are to be found in that
piously fraudulent work&mdash;the “Life of the Holy Child,”
by Martinez Moreno.

<span class="medium">THE EDICT OF BANISHMENT</span></h2>

<p>It was, as we have already suggested, the very
opportuneness with which the trial and sentence of
those concerned in the affair of La Guardia came to
afford Torquemada an additional argument to plead
with the Sovereigns his case against the Jews, which
has led so many historians&mdash;prior to M. Fidel Fita’s
discovery&mdash;to reject the story as an invention. Another
reason to discredit it lay in the circumstance that it
was circulated in Spain together with a number of
other stories that were obviously false and obviously
invented expressly for the purpose of defaming the
Jews and exciting popular indignation against them.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Ferdinand and Isabella pressed
triumphantly forward on their conquering progress
through Andalusia. Lucena, Coin, Ronda, and scores
of other Moorish strongholds in the southern hills
had fallen before the irresistible arms of the Christians;
and the Sovereigns, aided by Jewish gold&mdash;not merely
the gold extorted by confiscations, but moneys voluntarily
contributed by their Hebrew subjects&mdash;pushed
on to the reduction of Malaga, as the prelude to the
leaguer of Granada itself, the last bulwark of Islam
in Spain. This fell on January 2, 1492, and with it
fell the Moslem dominion, which had endured in the
peninsula, with varying fortunes, for nearly 800 years.</p>

<p>It might well have seemed to the Catholic
Sovereigns that the conquest of Spain and the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">357</span>
victory there of Christianity were at last accomplished,
had not Torquemada been at their elbow to point out
that the triumph of the Cross would never be complete
in that land as long as the Jews continued to be
numbered among its inhabitants.</p>

<p>He protested that the evils resulting from intercourse
between Christian and Jew were notorious and
unconquerable. He declared that in spite of the
Inquisition, and in spite of all other measures that
had been taken to keep Christian and Jew apart,
the evil persisted and was as rampant as ever. He
urged that the Jews continued unabatedly to pervert
the Christians, and that they must so continue as long
as they were tolerated to remain in the peninsula.
Particularly was this notorious in the case of the
Marranos or New-Christians, to whom the Israelites
gave no peace until&mdash;by indoctrination or by the
scorn and abuse they heaped upon them&mdash;they had
seduced them back into error.</p>

<p>And in proof of what he urged he was able to
point to the affair of La Guardia, to the outrage to
the crucifix at Casar de Palomero, and to other matters
of a kindred nature that had lately been brought to
light.</p>

<p>He called upon the Sovereigns to redeem the
promise they had made to give consideration to this
matter&mdash;a consideration which, in answer to his
earlier pleadings, they had postponed until the war
against Granada should have been brought to its
conclusion.</p>

<p>In the meantime the Jews themselves had fought
strenuously against the banishment with which they
saw themselves threatened. Eloquent had been their
appeals to the Sovereigns. And the Sovereigns could
hardly turn a deaf ear to the intercessions of subjects
to whom they owed so much. For was it not the very
Jews who had supplied the Spanish crown with the
sinews for this campaign against the enemies of the
Cross? Was it not owing to wonderful Hebrew administration&mdash;an
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">358</span>
administration gratefully surrendered
to them&mdash;that the army of the Cross was equipped,
maintained, and paid out of moneys that the Jews
themselves had provided?</p>

<p>They found means to bring this to the attention of
the Sovereigns, as a proof of the loyalty of their devotion,
as a proof of their value to the Spanish nation.
And the Sovereigns had other experiences of the
loyalty and affection which had ever been manifested
towards them by their long-suffering Hebrew subjects.
When, for instance, their son, the Infante Don Juan
was proclaimed in Aragon, after the Cortes of Toledo,
the Jews had been foremost in the jubilant and loving
receptions that everywhere met their Highnesses in
the course of their progress through the kingdom of
Ferdinand. Whilst the Spaniards were content to
greet their Sovereigns with acclamations, the Jews
went to meet them with valuable gifts.<a id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">226</a> Bernaldez
tells us<a id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">227</a> of the splendid offering made to their Highnesses
by the Aljama of Zaragoza. It consisted of
twelve calves, twelve lambs, and a curious and very
beautiful service of silver borne by twelve Jews, a rich
silver cup full of gold castellanos<a id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">228</a> and a jar of silver&mdash;“all
of which the Sovereigns received and prized,
returning many thanks.”</p>

<p>Loyalty so tangibly manifested, of which this is
but an instance, must have some weight in the scales
against fanaticism; further, it seems impossible that
the Sovereigns should have been altogether blind to
the possible jeopardizing of the industrial prosperity of
the kingdom if those chiefly responsible for it were
driven out.</p>

<p>So they had put off their decision in the matter,
urging that the present war demanded their full attention.
But now that the conquest of Granada was
accomplished, they were forced to look the matter in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">359</span>
the face. For Torquemada was giving them no peace.
Hard-driven by his fanatical hatred of the Israelites,
the Grand Inquisitor had resolved upon his course
and was determined that nothing should turn him
aside.</p>

<p>Constantly were his arguments&mdash;all founded upon
the love of Christ&mdash;poured into the ears of the Sovereigns,
and to prove the soundness of these arguments
he was able to bring forward concrete facts&mdash;or, at
least, matters upon which the courts of the Inquisition
had pronounced&mdash;prominent among which would be
the affair of La Guardia.</p>

<p>And what Torquemada was doing by the Sovereigns,
the brethren of his order were doing by Spain.
Popular indignation against the Jews, so easy to arouse,
already inflamed by the outrage at Casar de Palomero
and the crucifixion at La Guardia, was further and
unscrupulously excited by false stories that were set
in circulation. It was even alleged that the illness of
the Prince Don Juan was the result of Hebrew infamy,
and to explain this a foolish, wicked story was invented,
put about and universally accepted.</p>

<p>Llorente quotes this story from the “Anonymo de
Zaragoza.”<a id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">229</a> It is to the effect that the prince coveted
a golden pomander-ball worn by his physician, who
was of a Jewish family, and this gewgaw the physician
ended by relinquishing to his patient. One day, moved
by youthful curiosity, the boy wished to see what the
pomander contained. Opening it, he discovered an
indecent and blasphemous picture, insulting to the
divinity of Christ. The sight of it inspired the princeling
with such horror and grief that he fell sick. Nor
would he divulge the origin of his illness until the
instances of his father succeeded in drawing the secret
from him, whereupon “it was resolved to take proceedings
against the physician and to sentence him to
the fire.”</p>

<p>This trivial, scurrilous, and obviously untruthful
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">360</span>
story would not be worth repeating did it not serve
the purpose of showing the sort of rumours that
were being propagated to the hurt of the Israelites.</p>

<p>Another story that was circulated alleged that in
Valencia there had also been an attempt by a number
of Jews to crucify a Christian boy. This is recorded
in that scurrilous, infamous publication, “Centinela
contra Judios,” by Frey Francisco de Torrejoncillo.
We have already referred to it more than once. It
was first printed in 1676, and is the book of a friar
of the Order of St. Francis, a disgraceful work which
proves its author to have been as barefaced as he was
barefooted. It is a collection of stupid lies and forgeries,
and, it is scarcely an exaggeration to add, obscenities;
it may be another instance of those frauds termed
pious, but it is scarcely to the credit of a Church exercising,
by means of the “Index Expurgatorius,” a censorship
of the press&mdash;to have permitted the circulation
of a work of this order from the pen of a churchman.</p>

<p>This, however, is by the way.</p>

<p>The story here to be recorded is taken, Torrejoncillo
tells us, from the “Sermon de la Cruz” by Frey
Felipe de Salazar.<a id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">230</a> On a Good Friday evening a youth
who was in a street of Valencia observed several men
entering a house. Considering this to be strange&mdash;although
no suspicious circumstance is mentioned&mdash;he
approached the door and listened. He heard them
say, “There seems to be some one at the door.”
Fearing that a brawl might be the result if he were
discovered there when they opened, he drew his sword
and fled. (How the drawing of his sword was calculated
to assist his flight the author does not think it
worth while to inform us.) As he was running he
came upon a patrol, which seized him, demanding to
know whither he was hurrying in this fashion with a
naked sword in his hand. He related what he had
witnessed, whereupon the officer, not only for the
purpose of testing the truth of the story but also that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">361</span>
he might ascertain to what end so many men should be
assembling, went to the house and knocked.</p>

<p>The door was opened by a Jew, who began to make
obvious excuses to him. Suddenly the officer heard
a child’s voice within the house, crying, “These men
want to crucify me.”</p>

<p>The Jews were taken, the house demolished, and
on the site of it was built the Church of Santa Cruz.</p>

<p>In this collection of lies and forgeries are included
the “letter of Christ to Abgarus,” another letter of
Pontius Pilate to Tiberius dilating upon the miracles
of the Saviour, and a letter from the Jews of Constantinople
to those of Toledo, which played an
important part in this anti-semitic campaign.</p>

<p>It was the Cardinal-Archbishop Juan Martinez
Siliceo who was alleged to have discovered this letter
in Toledo. We are to suppose that he also found in
Toledo the letter to the Jews of Constantinople to
which this is a reply, for the chroniclers are able
to supply us with the texts of both,<a id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">231</a> a circumstance
which no one at the time appears to have considered
strange.</p>

<p>The letter to Constantinople ran as follows:</p>

<h3>“<span class="smcap">The Jews of Spain</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">The Jews of
Constantinople</span></h3>

<p>“Honoured Jews, health and grace.&mdash;Know that
the King of Spain compels us to become Christians,
deprives us of property and of life, destroys our
synagogues and otherwise oppresses us, so that we
are uncertain what to do.</p>

<p>“By the Law of Moses we beseech you to
assemble, and to send us with all speed the declaration
made in your assembly.</p>

<p>
“<span class="smcap">Chamarro</span>, Prince of the Jews of Spain.”<br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">362</span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>To this the answer received from Constantinople
was in the following terms:</p>

<h3>“<span class="smcap">The Jews of Constantinople</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">The Jews
of Spain</span></h3>

<p>“Beloved Brethren in Moses,&mdash;We have your
letter in which you tell us of the travail and suffering
you are enduring there.... The opinion of the
Rabbis is that since the King of Spain attempts to
make you Christians, you should become Christians;
since he deprives you of your goods and property, you
should make your children merchants, that they may
deprive the Christians of theirs; since you say that
they deprive you of your lives, make your sons
apothecaries and physicians to deprive the Christians
of theirs; since they destroy your synagogues, make
your sons clerics that they may destroy the Christian
temples; since you say that you suffer other wrongs,
make your sons enter public offices that thus they may
render the Christians subject to them.</p>

<p>“Do not depart from these orders, and you will
see that from oppressed you will come to be held of
great account.</p>

<p>
“<span class="smcap">Hus&eacute;e</span>, Prince of the Jews of Constantinople.”<br />
</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The matter of these letters&mdash;so very obviously
forged&mdash;was freely circulated. Being accepted, public
indignation was suddenly increased by fear. Imaginations
were stimulated, and stories based upon these
injunctions of Prince Hus&eacute;e became current, nothing
being ever too flagrant for popular consumption. It
was related that a Jewish physician in Toledo carried
poison in one of his finger-nails, and that with this he
touched the tongues of the patients he visited, thus
killing them. Of another physician it was reported
that he deliberately poisoned the wounds he was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">363</span>
desired to heal.<a id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">232</a> And that there were many other
such stories current is beyond all doubt.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>What use, if any, Torquemada made of those forged
letters and the stories that were their offspring, we do
not know. But it would be strange if the circulation
and acceptance of such matters displeased him, since
they were plainly calculated to forward his aims and
compel the Sovereigns to lend an ear to his insistent
denunciations of the Jews.</p>

<p>Incessantly he preached the need for religious
unity in a united Spain. Indeed, Spain, he urged,
never could be united, never could deserve the blessing
of Heaven, until all men in that land were the
children of God, true believers in the Holy Roman
Catholic Apostolic Faith. God had greatly favoured
Ferdinand and Isabella, the friar continued. He had
collected the various elements of the peninsula into one
mighty kingdom, which He had subjected to their sceptre.
Let them fuse those elements into a solid whole, rejecting
all those who resist this fusion&mdash;and this for
the honour and glory of God and of their own kingdom.</p>

<p>Before this terrific gospel of Religious Unity
nothing could stand. Humanitarian considerations,
principles of equity, indebtedness and gratitude are
mere trifles to be swept away by that hurricane of
religious argument.</p>

<p>The Sovereigns found themselves face to face
with an issue of such a magnitude that no temporal
considerations could be allowed to weigh. And to the
pressure of Torquemada’s fierce arguments was added
now the pressure of public opinion, cunningly excited
by his lieutenants. To the voice of God from the lips
of the Grand Inquisitor was added now the <i>vox populi</i>&mdash;the
voice of God from the lips of the people.</p>

<p>And so clamorous was this popular voice, so insistent
were the accusations which it levelled against the
Israelites, of ritual infamies and of seducing back to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">364</span>
the Law of Moses their apostate brethren, that the
Jews were warned of the storm that was about to break
over their luckless heads.</p>

<p>Torquemada’s demand was that they must receive
baptism or go.</p>

<p>The Sovereigns hesitated still. In Isabella perhaps
the voice of humanity was too strong to be entirely
stifled by the dictates of bigotry.</p>

<p>But Torquemada’s strength of purpose was the
greater and more irresistible by virtue of its purity
and singleness of aim. Obviously he was no self-seeker.
Obviously he had no worldly ends to serve.
What he demanded, he demanded in the name of the
religion which he served&mdash;solely for the greater honour
and glory of his God; and to sovereigns of the temper
of Ferdinand and Isabella demands so inspired are not
easily resisted.</p>

<p>And although it was clear that he sought no worldly
advantage for himself, he did not scruple to use the
prospect of the Sovereigns’ worldly advantage as a
weapon to combat their reluctance; he did not hesitate
to dangle before their eyes temporal advantages that
must result from the banishment of the Israelites.
To arguments upon religious grounds he added arguments
of worldly expediency, arguments which cannot
have failed of effect upon the acquisitive nature of
the King.</p>

<p>Never, urged the Grand Inquisitor, would Spain
know tranquillity whilst she harboured Jews. They
were predatory; they were untrustworthy; their sole
objective was the satisfaction of their pecuniary interest&mdash;the
only interest they knew; and their acquisitiveness
would always dispose them to serve any enemy
of the crown so that it should profit them to do so.<a id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">233</a></p>

<p>But Torquemada was not the only advocate before
the royal court. The Jews were there, too, pleading
on their own behalf, with an eloquence that seemed for
a moment on the point of prevailing&mdash;for the seductive
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">365</span>
chink of gold was persuasively intermingled with their
protestations.</p>

<p>They urged their past services to the crown, and
promised even greater services in the future; they
swore that henceforth they would be more observant
of the harsh laws formulated by Alfonso XI&mdash;that
they would keep to their ghettos as prescribed, withdrawing
to them at nightfall, and abstaining rigorously
from all such intercourse with Christians as was by
law forbidden. Last and most eloquent argument of
all, they offered through Abraham Seneor and Isaac
Abarbanel&mdash;the two Jews who had undertaken and
so admirably effected the equipment of the Castilian
army for the campaign against Granada&mdash;that in
addition to giving this undertaking they would subscribe
30,000 ducats towards the expenses of the war
against the Moslem.</p>

<p>Ferdinand’s hesitation was increased by this offer.
Ever in need of money as the Sovereigns were, the
consideration of this gold not only tempted them, but
it would undoubtedly have conquered them had not
Torquemada been at hand. But for his violent intervention
it is more than probable that the cruel edict
of banishment would never have been promulgated.</p>

<p>The Dominican, learning what was afoot, thrust
himself into their Highnesses’ presence to denounce
their hesitation, and to put upon it the name which in
his opinion it deserved.</p>

<p>It is not difficult to picture him in that supreme
moment. It is one of those rare occasions on which
this being whom we have compared to a <i>Deus ex
machina</i>, a cold stern spirit ruling and guiding the
terrible organization of the Inquisition which he has
himself established, steps forth in the flesh, a living,
throbbing man.</p>

<p>You behold him pale, a little breathless in the
excitement and anger by which he is possessed. His
deep-set eyes glow sombrely with the fever of
fanatical zeal and indignation. He draws his lean
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">366</span>
old frame erect. In his shrivelled, sinewy old hands
he flaunts aloft a crucifix.</p>

<p>It is an intense moment. Everything contributes
to it: the long-drawn duel between religion and
humanity, between clericalism and Christianity, of
which this is at last the climax; and nothing so
much as the figure offered by the Jews. This <i>thirty</i>
thousand is unfortunately reminiscent. It permits
the Prior of Holy Cross to draw a very daring
parallel.</p>

<p>“Judas,” he cries, “once sold the Son of God for
thirty pieces. Your Highnesses think to sell Him
again for thirty thousand. Here you have Him.
Sell Him, then, but acquit me of all share in the
transaction.”</p>

<p>And, crashing the crucifix upon the table before
their startled Highnesses, he abruptly leaves the
chamber.<a id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">234</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Thus Torquemada conquered.</p>

<p>The edict of expulsion was signed at Granada on
March 31 of that year 1492&mdash;that glorious year in
which Spain finally completed the erection of her
monarchy upon the ruins of the old Visigothic
kingdom, and in which the navigator Columbus laid a
new world at the foot of the throne of the Catholic
Sovereigns.<a id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">235</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">367</span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI<br />

<span class="medium">THE EXODUS FROM SPAIN</span></h2>

<p>It was solemnly declared in the edict of expulsion
that this decree was promulgated solely in obedience
to the pressing need to cut off at the roots, once
for all time, the evils arising out of the intercourse
between Christians and Jews, since all other efforts
hitherto undertaken with the same intent had proved
fruitless.<a id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">236</a></p>

<p>By this edict all Jews of any age and either sex
who should refuse to receive baptism must quit Spain
within three months, and never return, under pain
of death and the confiscation of their property.</p>

<p>The cruelty of this expatriation calls for little
exposition. Spain was the motherland of these Jews.
For centuries it had been the home of their ancestors,
and they held it in the affection implanted in the heart
of each of us for the country which is his own. They
must depart out of it, into exile in some foreign land,
and the only terms upon which they could obtain immunity
from that harsh decree was by the sacrifice of
something dearer still, something as dear to them as
honour itself. They must be false to the faith of
their fathers and forswear the God of Israel.</p>

<p>That was the choice forced upon the Children of
Judah&mdash;the choice which the arrogant Christian
Church had been forcing upon all men from the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">368</span>
moment that she had found herself mistress of the
power to do so.</p>

<p>It was decreed that after the expiry of the three
months allowed them in which to settle their affairs
and be gone no Christian would be suffered to befriend
or assist them, to give them food or shelter, under
pain of being called to account as an abettor of
heretics.</p>

<p>Until their departure the persons and property
of the exiled were nominally under the protection
of the Sovereigns. They were permitted to dispose
of what property they possessed, and to take
the proceeds with them in bills of exchange<a id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">237</a> or in
merchandise, but not in gold, which it was forbidden
to carry out of the country.</p>

<p>Little greater would have been the injury done
them if their property had been confiscated outright.
For being compelled to dispose of it at such short
notice, and the buyers knowing that it must be sold,
and eager to take advantage of these forced sales,
what chance had the Jews of realizing anything that
should approach its value? How could they avoid
the pitiless Christian exploitation of their miserable
position?</p>

<p>“The Christians obtained,” says Bernaldez, “much
property and many very rich houses and estates for
little money; the Jews went about offering these, and
could not find any buyers, so that they were forced
to barter here a house for an ass, there a vineyard
for a piece of cloth.”<a id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">238</a></p>

<p>From just this passage in the chronicle of an
author whose detestation of the Jews we have earlier
considered may be conceived how terrible was their
distress, and how mercilessly was advantage taken
of it by the Christians.</p>

</div>

<p>Amador de los Rios adds that entire ghettos
entered into the sacrifice, and that, the Jews being
utterly unable to dispose of such communal property,
they were forced to make gifts of it to the municipalities
that had shown them so little pity.<a id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">239</a></p>

<p>Torquemada in his great zeal for the Faith was
not content to leave matters there. His chief aim,
after all, was not the expulsion of the Jews, but their
conversion and the effacement of their creed. As a
means to that end was it that he had wrung the edict
of banishment from the Sovereigns.</p>

<p>Upon this campaign of conversion he now sent
forth his army of Dominicans. He published an
edict, with the royal sanction, in which he exhorted
the Israelites to receive baptism, laying stress upon
the fact that those who should do so before the expiry
of the three months appointed for their emigration
would be entitled to remain.</p>

<p>In every city, in every village, in every hamlet,
in churches, in market-places, and at street-corners
his black-and-white Dominicans sought by exhortation
and argument to induce the Jews to receive the
waters of baptism, thereby securing their well-being
and prosperity in this world and their eternal salvation
in the next. The preachers penetrated to the
very synagogues in their zeal, and exerted themselves
even in the Jewish temples, by the promises they
held out of temporal advantage, to lead the Jews
into the fold of Christianity. No place was sacred
from the friars-preachers. In Segovia, when the
hour of departure approached, the Jews spent three
days in their cemetery weeping over the graves of
their dead, which they were abandoning. And there
were zealous Dominicans who intruded upon that
sorrow, and seized the opportunity to preach conversion
to that piteous assembly.<a id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">240</a></p>

<p>But the response to all these sermons was only
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">370</span>
slight. If Torquemada’s friars were preaching Christianity
on the one hand, and attempting by argument
and bribery to induce the Hebrews to embrace it, the
Rabbis, on the other, were no less energetic in their
efforts to encourage the Israelites to stand firm in
their fidelity to their God, to resist the temptations of
corruption, and to remember that even as God had
delivered them out of Egypt and led them into the
Land of Plenty, so in leading them out of Spain
would He see that His children did not suffer loss of
honour or of worldly goods.</p>

<p>Whether the Israelites believed or not, the great
body of them remained staunch, and sooner than
accept ease and advancement at the price of baptism,
they firmly envisaged exile and the loss of their
property, which the royal decree inspired by Torquemada
rendered inevitable.</p>

<p>Bernaldez tells us that, notwithstanding the law
against taking gold out of Spain, many of the exiles
did take it in large quantities concealed about them&mdash;which
is extremely probable. Not quite so probable
is the common rumour which he reports, that they
reduced many gold ducats to pellets with their teeth,
and then swallowed them upon arriving at seaports or
other places where they were to be searched, thus
carrying the gold away in their stomachs. The
women in particular, he says, were great offenders in
this respect, and&mdash;again reporting the voice of common
rumour&mdash;he informs us that some women contrived to
swallow as many as thirty ducats each.<a id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">241</a></p>

<p>The story of this swallowed gold evidently got
abroad, to add to their affliction; and we are told that
some who sailed from Cadiz to Fez, and who fell into
the hands of Moors upon landing on the coast of
Barbary, were not only plundered of their belongings,
but were in several cases ripped open by these
brigands in their quest for gold.<a id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">242</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">371</span></p>

<p>Within the little period of three months appointed
them, the Israelites sold or bartered what they could,
and abandoned that for which they found no buyers.
All boys and girls of the age of twelve or more they
married, so that each nubile female should set out
under the protection of a husband.<a id="FNanchor_243" href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">243</a></p>

<p>The exodus from Spain began in the first week in
July of 1492. Those amongst the exiles who were
wealthy supported their poorer brethren, in pursuance
of the custom that had ever prevailed in their ghettos.
Many who had been very wealthy and masters of
thriving trades abandoned their prosperity, and trusting
to what Bernaldez terms “the vain hope of
their blindness,” they took the harsh road into banishment.</p>

<p>The parish priest of Palacios has left us a vivid
picture of this emigration.<a id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">244</a> It is a picture over which
Christianity must weep in shame.</p>

<p>On foot, on horseback, on donkeys, in carts, young
and old, stalwart and feeble, healthy and ailing, some
dying and some being born, and many falling by the
way, they formed forlorn processions toiling onwards
in the heat and dust of that July. On every road that
led out of the country&mdash;on those that went southwards
to the sea, or westwards to Portugal, or eastwards to
Navarre&mdash;these straggling human droves were to be
met, and they presented a spectacle so desolate that
there was no Christian who did not pity them.</p>

<p>Succour them none dared, by virtue of the decree
of the Grand Inquisitor; but on every hand they were
exhorted to accept baptism and thus set a term upon
their tribulations. And some, unable to endure more
in their utter exhaustion and hopelessness, gave way
and forswore the God of Israel.</p>

<p>But these were comparatively few. The Rabbis
were at hand to encourage and stimulate them. The
women and the young men were bidden to sing as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">372</span>
they marched, and timbrels were sounded to hearten
these wretched multitudes.</p>

<p>The Andalusians made for Cadiz, where it was
their intention to take ship. Those of Aragon also
turned towards the coast, repairing to Cartagena;
whilst many Catalans sailed for Italy, where&mdash;singular
anomaly!&mdash;a Catalan Pope (Roderigo Borgia) was to
afford them shelter and protection in the very heart of
the system that was oppressing and persecuting them.</p>

<p>Of those who arrived at Cadiz, Bernaldez says that
at sight of the sea there was great clamour amongst
them. Their imaginations fired by the recent sermons
of the Rabbis, in which they had been likened to their
forefathers departing out of the Egyptian captivity,
they confidently expected to behold here a repetition
of the miracle of the Red Sea, and that the waters
would separate to allow them a dry-shod passage into
Barbary.</p>

<p>Those who went westwards were permitted by
King John of Portugal to enter his kingdom and
abide there for six months upon payment of a small
tax of one cruzado each.<a id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">245</a> Of these many settled in
Portugal and engaged there in trade, which they were
permitted to do subject to a tribute of 100 cruzados
levied on each family.</p>

<p>It is no part of our present task to follow the
Israelites into exile and observe the miserable fate
that overtook so many of them, alike at the hands of
the followers of the gentle Christ and at those of the
Children of the Prophet. Many sages and rabbis
were amongst those who abandoned Spain, and in
their number was Isahak Aboab, the last Prince of
the Castilian Jews, and Isaac Abarbanel, the sometime
farmer of the royal taxes.</p>

<p>“The expulsion,” writes this last, “was accompanied
by pillage on land and sea; and amongst those
who, stricken and sorrowful, set out for foreign lands,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">373</span>
was I. With great trouble I contrived to reach
Naples, but I was unable to find any repose there in
consequence of the French invasion. The French
were masters of the city, the very inhabitants having
abandoned their Government. All rose against our
congregation, expelling rich and poor, men and
women, fathers and sons of the Children of Zion,
and reducing them to the greatest ruin and misery.
Several abandoned their religion, fearing lest their
blood should be shed as water, or that they might be
sold into slavery; for men and women, young and
old, were being carried off in ships without pity for
their lamentations, compelled to abandon their Law
and continue in captivity.”</p>

<p>France and England received some of the exiles,
others went to settle in the Far East. Most wretched,
perhaps, were those who landed on the coast of Africa
and attempted by way of the desert to reach Fez,
where there was a Jewish colony. They were beset
by a horde of plundering tribesmen, who pillaged them
of their belongings, treated them with the utmost
cruelty and inhumanity, ravished their women under
their very eyes, and left them stripped and utterly
broken. Their sufferings had reached the limit of
their endurance. The survivors sought baptism at
the first Christian settlement they reached, and many
of these returned to their native Spain, having thus
qualified themselves for readmission.</p>

<p>There were many otherwise who, similarly unable
to endure the hardships which they met abroad, broke
down at last, accepted baptism and returned, or else
returned clamouring for the baptism that should
enable them to dwell in peace in the land of their
birth.</p>

<p>For three years, says Bernaldez, there was a constant
stream of returning Jews, who having abandoned
all for their faith, had now abandoned their faith itself,
and came back to make a fresh start. They were
baptized in groups, all at once, by the sprinkling of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">374</span>
hyssop over them.<a id="FNanchor_246" href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">246</a> Bernaldez himself baptized a
hundred of them at Palacios, and from what he beheld,
“I considered fulfilled,” he writes, “the prophecy of
David&mdash;‘Covertentur ad vesperam et famen patiuntur
ut canes et circundabunt civitatem.’”</p>

<p>The priest of Palacios estimates at 36,000 the
Jewish families that accepted banishment,<a id="FNanchor_247" href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">247</a> which
would represent some 200,000 souls. But Salazar de
Mendoza and Zurita set the total exiles at twice
that number,<a id="FNanchor_248" href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">248</a> whilst Mariana carries it as high as
800,000.<a id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">249</a> More reliable perhaps than any of these
is the estimate left by the Jewish writers, who say
that in the year 5252 of the Creation 300,000 Jews
left Spain, the land in which their forbears had dwelt
for close upon 2,000 years.<a id="FNanchor_250" href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">250</a></p>

<p>These figures bring home to us the gravity of the
step taken by the Sovereigns when they consented to
the banishment of the Jews; and if anything had been
wanting to make us appreciate the irresistible quality
of Torquemada and of the fanaticism for which he
stood, these figures would supply it.</p>

<p>The proposed expulsion must fully have been discussed
in council before the edict was promulgated;<a id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">251</a>
and it must have been obvious that Spain could not
fail to be left materially the poorer if some 40,000
industrious families were driven out. It is unthinkable
that king or councillor should not have raised the
question of the inexpediency, of the positive danger
attaching to such a measure. Yet certain it is that
neither councillor nor king could stand against the
stern, uncompromising friar, in whom they saw the
representative of a God that was not to be trifled
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">375</span>
with&mdash;a God whom their conceptions transformed
into some vindictive pagan deity.</p>

<p>Torquemada’s crucifix so dramatically flung into
the scales had definitely settled the question.</p>

<p>The Sultan Bajazet, who welcomed and sheltered
not a few of the fugitives in Turkey, was overcome
with amazement at this blunder of statecraft, so that
he is reported to have asked whether this king were
seriously to be taken for a great statesman who
impoverished his kingdom to enrich another’s.</p>

<p>What the Grand Turk perceived so readily, priest-ridden
Ferdinand dared not perceive.</p>

<p>In banishing Jew and Moslem from her soil&mdash;for
the Moor was soon to follow, though temporarily permitted
to remain by virtue of the terms of the capitulation
of Granada&mdash;Spain banished her merchants and
financiers on the one hand, and her agriculturists and
artisans on the other; in short, she banished her
workers, the productive section of her community.
It is accounted by many that she did so with the fullest
consciousness of the consequences&mdash;an act of heroic
sacrifice to principle and to religious convictions. And
it may be that she accounted herself God-rewarded by
the gift of a new world for this sacrifice to God.</p>

<p>The arts, the industries, manufactures, agriculture,
and commerce have been bewailing for four hundred
years the lack of hands to serve them. The New
World proved but an illusory and transient compensation.
Its gold could not furnish Spain with the
workers that she lacked. On the contrary, it increased
that lack. The New World repaid herself with interest
for what she gave. In return for the gifts she poured
into the lap of Spain she took to herself the very
children of Spain, luring them overseas with the
fabulous tales of riches easily to be acquired. Driven
by this greed of gold, multitudes of families emigrated
to increase the depopulation of their country. And
when, in the course of time, those children of Spain in
the New World had grown to a sufficient strength to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">376</span>
claim their emancipation, they threw off the yoke of
the motherland and distributed among themselves her
vast possessions. They left her bare indeed, who by
her own act was without home-resources, to realize
perhaps at last what manner of service had been
rendered her by the Prior of Holy Cross.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Moors of Granada, meanwhile, had obtained
from Ferdinand a promise that the Inquisition should
not be set up in Granada within the following forty
years, nor yet any prosecution instituted of Moriscoes
(baptized Moslems) for the observance of Mohammedan
customs.</p>

<p>The term, however, set too great a strain upon
priestly patience. In 1526&mdash;long before the expiry of
the period marked&mdash;the Holy Office crept slyly into
Granada upon the pretext that it was requisite to
watch the many suspected Marranos who had gone to
reside there in the shelter of the immunity enjoyed by
the Moriscoes. That it was the merest pretext is
shown by the circumstance that already, as early as
1505, the Holy Office of Cordova had been moving
in Granada and instituting there, when occasion arose,
proceedings against Judaizers.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">377</span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXVII">CHAPTER XXVII<br />

<span class="medium">THE LAST “INSTRUCTIONS” OF TORQUEMADA</span></h2>

<p>The expulsion of the Jews may be considered the
supreme and crowning work of Torquemada’s life.
It marks the high meridian of his achievement.
Hereafter his career dwindles gradually in importance
in a measure as it sinks slowly to its setting.</p>

<p>In Rome, meanwhile, in that year 1492, a new
Pontiff&mdash;Roderigo Borgia&mdash;had ascended the throne
of St. Peter under the title of Alexander VI, and from
this Pontiff’s hands Torquemada received his confirmation
in the great office which he held&mdash;a confirmation
which, being couched in the otiose terms of
affection not uncommon in papal bulls, seems to have
led many to believe that Alexander viewed Torquemada
and the Holy Office of Spain with particular
fondness. As a matter of fact, this Pope’s attempts
to curb the excessive rigour of the Grand Inquisitor
were less lethargic&mdash;we dare not say more energetic&mdash;than
those exerted by Sixtus IV and Innocent VIII;
and it was Alexander VI who, weary of complaints,
finally contrived the retirement of the Prior of Holy
Cross.</p>

<p>But that was not yet. Before that came to pass,
the scandals of secret absolutions sold and subsequently
rescinded by the Holy See were now
repeated. Vigorous appeals were made to the Holy
Father against the procedure of the Grand Inquisitor,
and the Holy Father, acting upon the advice of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">378</span>
Apostolic Court, dispatched his briefs of absolution.
Torquemada, incensed once more by this fresh interference
with his jurisdiction, made his appeal to the
Sovereigns, and jointly with them laid his protests
before the Pope, who complacently cancelled the
briefs that had been paid for&mdash;or rather that part of
the absolution which concerned the temporal courts.
For the moneys received it could be shown that full
value had been given, since these absolutions still
held good in the tribunal of conscience. We are
familiar by this time with the argument.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Torquemada’s enemies in Spain were increasing
now at an alarming rate. But, secure in the royal
protection, this old man steadily and ruthlessly
advanced along the path of intolerance, undismayed
by ill-will. Conscious of the hatred he provoked, he
may have gloried in the maledictions hurled against
him by the persecuted, conceiving that the malevolence
of the infidel would render his deeds the
more acceptable in the sight of his God. But whatever
the equanimity with which he may have confronted
spiritual hostility, he took his measures to secure himself
from its temporal manifestations. That he went
in dread of attack is evinced not only by the fact that
he was never seen abroad without his numerous escort
of armed familiars, but further by the circumstance
that he never sat down to dine without a horn of
unicorn upon his table as a charm against poison.<a id="FNanchor_252" href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">252</a></p>

<p>So arbitrarily and arrogantly did he widen the
sphere of autocratic jurisdiction accorded him that
soon he was usurping the functions of the civil courts,
thereby provoking a still deeper resentment. He
conducted the business of the Holy Office in such a
manner that all other courts of the kingdom became
subservient to it, and where the magistrates, resenting
these encroachments, attempted to withstand him, or
even to question his authority, they were&mdash;as had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">379</span>
happened in the case of the Captain-General of
Valencia&mdash;promptly charged with lack of zeal and
even impeached as hinderers of the Holy Office. They
were compelled to submit to humiliating penances,
which in the case of magistrates entailed a total loss
of dignity and prestige. And such was the ascendancy
this man had gained by now that complaints or
appeals to the Sovereigns were useless.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, however, and by his own act, his
enemies at home had found two powerful mediators
with the Pope, two powerful advocates to plead their
cause before the Apostolic Court. These were Juan
Arias Davila, Bishop of Segovia, and Pedro de Aranda,
Bishop of Calahorra.</p>

<p>Torquemada’s frenzied intolerance of men of Jewish
blood was by no means confined to those who practised
the Law of Moses. It extended to those who had
accepted baptism and to their descendants, and it kept
alive his mistrust of them.</p>

<p>Very markedly is this exhibited in the proceedings
he instituted against the two bishops mentioned, notwithstanding
the Papal decree which inhibited inquisitors
from proceeding against prelates save by
special pontifical authority.</p>

<p>The Bishop of Segovia&mdash;Juan Arias Davila&mdash;was
the grandson of a Jew who had received baptism in
the reign of Henry IV, and had held an honourable
position at the court of that king by whom he had
been ennobled. Considering the ecclesiastical eminence
attained by his grandson&mdash;now a very old man&mdash;one
would imagine that the latter should have been secure
from inquisitorial attacks on the score of alleged
offences committed by his ancestor against the Faith.
But the terrible Torquemada contrived to rake up
some matters against the long-deceased <i>converso</i>,
accused him of having re-Judaized before his death,
and instituted proceedings which must have resulted in
the destitution, degradation and infamy of the bishop,
his descendant.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">380</span></p>

<p>“It sufficed,” says Llorente on this subject,<a id="FNanchor_253" href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">253</a> “that
a deceased Jew should have been fortunate and wealthy
to seek cause of suspicion upon his faith and religion,
such was the ill-will against those of Jewish blood,
such the desire to mortify them, and such the covetousness
to absorb their property.”</p>

<p>To these proceedings Davila set up a stout resistance
and made appeal to the Pope, whereupon Torquemada
experienced his first serious check. The Pope
ordered him to stick to the letter of the law, and to
lay the matter before the Apostolic Court, as was due.
Thither went the Bishop also, to defend his grandfather’s
bones from the accusation lodged. He was
well received by the Pontiff, who ultimately gave
him the victory over Torquemada, for when the
case was tried his father’s memory was cleared of all
guilt.<a id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">254</a></p>

<p>In the meanwhile, however, Davila had not only
received a very kindly welcome at the Vatican, but,
pending his trial, he was given a position of honour,
and he was associated with Cardinal Borgia of Monreale
(Alexander’s nephew) when the latter went as papal
legate to Naples, to crown Alfonso II of Aragon.<a id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">255</a></p>

<p>Less fortunate was Pedro de Aranda, the other
accused Bishop. In his case, too, the proceedings
instituted were based upon the alleged Judaizing of his
deceased father&mdash;a Jew who had been baptized in the
time of St. Vincent Ferrer.</p>

<p>His case was tried at Valladolid, but the inquisitors
and the diocesan ordinary disagreed in their findings,
and in 1493 the Bishop, accompanied by his bastard
son Alfonso Solares, set out for Rome, to present in
person his appeal to the Pontiff. Him, too, the Pope
received with the utmost kindliness. His Holiness
issued a brief inhibiting the inquisitors, and relegating
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">381</span>
the case to the Bishop of Cordova and the Prior of
the Benedictines of Valladolid.</p>

<p>The case being tried by them, a verdict entirely
favourable to the Bishop was obtained, and his father’s
memory was acquitted of the charge preferred against
it. But the tribulations of the living son were not
permitted to end there. Torquemada would not suffer
that his prey should escape so easily.</p>

<p>Already in 1488 the Bishop had been defamed by
a suspicion of judaizing, and the Grand Inquisitor now
pressed that he should be called to answer to that
charge, forwarding the indictment under seal to Rome.</p>

<p>Pending the solution of the matter by the Apostolic
Court, Alexander not only treated Aranda well, but
heaped honours and favours upon him and his son.
The Bishop was sent to Venice as papal legate, he
was appointed Master of the Sacred Palace, whilst
upon his offspring was conferred the position of
apostolic prothonotary.<a id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">256</a></p>

<p>But despite the papal favour which he enjoyed, and
notwithstanding the fact that he called upwards of a
hundred witnesses to testify in his defence, he was
found guilty. It is said that his own witnesses helped
to bring about his conviction. The Pontifical Court
was obliged to sentence him to loss of all ecclesiastical
dignities and benefices, to degrade him and reduce
him to the lay estate, whereafter he was imprisoned in
Sant’ Angelo, and there he died a few years later.<a id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">257</a></p>

<p>Notwithstanding the sentence of the Apostolic
Court, Llorente finds it impossible to believe that
Aranda was really guilty of Judaizing. “It seems incredible
that it should have been so, considering that
he had preserved the reputation of good Catholic for
so long and with such applause that the Queen Donna
Isabella should have named him President of the
Council of Castile. His celebrating the Synodal
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">382</span>
Council in his bishopric argues zeal for the purity of
religion and its dogmas. That the witnesses called
should have deponed to any words or actions of his
that were contrary to this does not signify as much as
may at first appear, for we know, from a multitude of
instances, that to fast on Sunday, to abstain from work
on Saturday, to refuse to eat pork, to dislike the blood
of animals, and other similar matters, sufficed as grounds
upon which to declare a man a Judaizing heretic, and
this notwithstanding that, as any one knows to-day,
these are circumstances not at all at issue with a firm
adherence to the Catholic dogmas.”<a id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">258</a></p>

<p>His sentence, however, was not pronounced until
1498. Until then he enjoyed, as we have seen, great
favour at the Papal Court. Taking advantage of this,
he and the Bishop of Segovia not only acted as
mediators to lay their countrymen’s grievances against
Torquemada before the Pope, but, in their very natural
resentment at the injustice of the prosecutions instituted
against themselves, they went so far as to urge the
Pope to depose the Grand Inquisitor from his office.
And Llorente&mdash;who states this upon the authority of
Lumbreras&mdash;adds that these petitions would, of themselves,
have prevailed but for the royal protection
which Torquemada continued to enjoy.<a id="FNanchor_259" href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">259</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But the complaints of the Grand Inquisitor’s abuse
of his power continued to pour into Rome. They
multiplied to such an extent, they were of such a
nature, and they were presented by Spaniards of such
eminence at the court of the Spanish Pontiff, that thrice
was Torquemada forced to send an advocate to defend
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">383</span>
him before the Holy See.<a id="FNanchor_260" href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">260</a> And in the end Alexander
considered it necessary to take measures to circumvent
the royal protection which continued to oppose the
deposition of the Prior of Holy Cross.</p>

<p>Since to depose him were too aggressive a course
to adopt towards the Sovereigns, with whom the
Pontiff desired to preserve the friendliest relations, at
least Torquemada’s power must be curtailed. And so,
by a brief of June 23, 1494, indited with all the craft
and diplomacy of which Roderigo Borgia was a master,
a brief in which he assures the Grand Inquisitor that
“he cherishes him in the very bowels of affection for
his great labours in the exaltation of the Faith,” and
charged with tender solicitude for Torquemada’s failing
health, the Pontiff puts forward these infirmities as a
reason for assuming him no longer equal to discharge
single-handed the heavy duties of his office. Therefore
His Holiness considers it desirable to appoint him
assistants who will lighten the labour of his declining
years.</p>

<p>The assistants appointed by Alexander were
Martin Ponce de Leon, a Castilian nobleman who
was Archbishop of Messina, Don Inigo Manrique,
Bishop of Cordova (nephew of the prelate of the
same name who was Archbishop of Seville), Don
Francisco Sanchez de la Fuente, Bishop of Avila,
sometime Dean of Toledo and Councillor of the
Suprema, and Don Alonso Suarez de Fuentelsaz,
Bishop of Mondonedo, who had also held the
position of inquisitor.</p>

<p>These assistants were equipped by the Pontiff
with the amplest powers&mdash;powers as ample as
Torquemada’s own&mdash;so that they were in no sense
subservient to the Prior of Holy Cross. The term
“assistant” was a papal euphuism, serving thinly to
veil the fact that Torquemada’s autocratic rule was
virtually at an end.</p>

<p>Such was the absolute equality of the authority
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">384</span>
of each of the five Grand Inquisitors now in existence,
that it was explicitly set forth that any one of them
had power singly to determine any matter, or singly
to conclude any case that might have been initiated
by one of the other four.<a id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">261</a></p>

<p>But of the four assistants appointed only two
accepted office jointly with Torquemada. These
were the Bishop of Avila and the Archbishop of
Messina, who at once took up their duties.</p>

<p>The Pope went a step further on November 4
following, when by a supplementary brief he appointed
Sanchez de la Fuente (Bishop of Avila) to be Judge
of Appeal in cases of the Faith. And from now
onwards it is to Sanchez de la Fuente that the Pope
addresses his briefs concerning the conduct of the
affairs of the Holy Office. It was to him personally
that Alexander gave orders that when a bishop was
unable or unwilling to perform upon an offending
cleric of his diocese the ceremony of degradation,
this should be undertaken by the Bishop of Avila
himself, or else by a bishop by him appointed.</p>

<p>Thus it would seem that Torquemada had virtually
been superseded, and that Sanchez de la Fuente had
been rendered his superior. If so, that superiority
cannot have been more than nominal. In spite of
it, Torquemada remained the guiding spirit of the
Holy Office in Spain, the supreme arbiter and law-giver,
as we shall see when we come to consider his
last “Instructions,” published in 1498.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In spite of these measures taken by the Pope with
a view to softening inquisitorial severity and bringing
it within more reasonable bounds, complaints to Rome
seem to have continued unabatedly.</p>

<p>Far from restricting inquisitorial jurisdiction&mdash;as
was intended&mdash;the appointment of these assistant
Grand Inquisitors appears to have widened it. They
now went so far as themselves to sell and dispose
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">385</span>
of confiscated property&mdash;a matter which hitherto had
been conducted by the officers of the royal treasury.
And this was more than Ferdinand could stomach.
Where humanitarian considerations, where arguments
of political expediency had failed to curb his bigotry,
acquisitiveness seems easily to have carried the victory.
So that at last we see the King himself turning in
appeal to the Pope against this despotism of a court
upon which he had conferred the power to become
mightier than himself in his own kingdom.</p>

<p>The response to his appeal was the bull of
February 1495, commanding the inquisitors under
pain of excommunication to desist from their course,
and never to resort to it again save under royal
sanction. The power to proceed against inquisitors
in case of fraud or irregularity in this matter was
vested in the famous Francisco Ximenes de Cisneros.<a id="FNanchor_262" href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">262</a></p>

<p>This man, who has been called the Richelieu of
Spain, had risen from very humble beginnings, as a
barefoot friar-mendicant, to the very splendid eminence
of Primate of Spain&mdash;in which office he had just
succeeded Cardinal Mendoza, who died in that year
(1495).</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the following year Torquemada made his exit
from the Court, where for a decade he had been a
figure of an importance second only to that of the
Sovereigns themselves.</p>

<p>Crippled by gout, he withdrew to his monastery
at Avila.<a id="FNanchor_263" href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">263</a> There he now dwelt in retirement, an
emaciated old man in his seventy-sixth year, debilitated
and racked with bodily infirmities, but with all his
vigour and energy of mind unimpaired, his severity
as uncompromising as of old, his conscience entirely
at peace in the conviction that he had given of his best&mdash;indeed,
his all&mdash;to the service of his God.</p>

<p>But even now his retirement can have been little
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">386</span>
more than physical. His attention continued focussed
upon the Inquisition and engrossed by it. To the last
do we find him actively directing the procedure of that
tribunal of the Faith.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1498 he summoned the principal
inquisitors of the kingdom to the monastery of St.
Thomas of Avila, to the end that with himself they
might concert the promulgation of further decrees to
check abuses which had crept into the administration
of the justice of the Holy Office, proving inadequate
his enactments of 1484, 1485, and 1488.</p>

<p>These, the fourth “Instructions” of Torquemada,
were published on May 25, 1498. They contain a
good deal that seems calculated to soften the rigour
of the earlier decrees, yet much of this is more or less
illusory.</p>

<p>Let us very briefly consider the sixteen articles of
which they consist.</p>

<p>The first three provide: (I) that of the two inquisitors
appointed to each court one shall be a jurist and
the other a theologian, and that they shall not proceed
other than jointly to decree prison, torture, or publication
of witnesses; (II) that the inquisitors shall not
permit their officers to bear weapons in those places
where the bearing of weapons is forbidden; (III) that
no one shall be arrested save upon sufficient proof of
his guilt, and that all cases be disposed of with dispatch
and not delayed in the hope of discovering increased
justification to sentence.</p>

<p>This last clause merely repeats an earlier one that
we have already seen, and from this repetition we are
led to suppose that the former expression of the same
command had not received proper attention and obedience.
The stipulation that no arrest should be made
save where there was sufficient proof of guilt is not as
generous as it sounds. It is dependent upon what the
inquisitors would consider “sufficient proof”; this is
revealed by the jurisprudence of the Holy Office:
the accusation of a spiteful or malevolent person, or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">387</span>
a delation wrung from some wretch under torture,
would be accounted “sufficient proof” to justify the
arrest and its sequel. To abolish the inequitable
character of this it would have been necessary to have
rescinded the decree which accounted “semiplenal
proof” sufficient ground for taking action.</p>

<p>Very merciful in its terms is Article IV, which
sets forth that in proceedings against the dead the
inquisitors must absolve promptly where complete
proof of crime is not forthcoming, and not delay in the
hope of obtaining further proof, as legal delays are
very injurious to the children, who are unable to contract
marriage whilst such matters are <i>sub judice</i>. But
it comes a little late in the day. It comes when the
great harvest from the wealthy dead has been safely
garnered. Besides, no conditions imposed could
mitigate the horrible rigour of the enactment to
exhume and burn the bones of the dead together
with their effigies, and to reduce the children or grandchildren
to destitution and infamy, even when the
person convicted was known to have died penitent
and comforted by the sacraments of the Church&mdash;in
consequence of which, by their own Faith, the inquisitors
believed him to be saved.</p>

<p>Article V provides that when the tribunal shall
be short of money for salary, no further pecuniary
penances be imposed than would be the case if the
court had funds in hand.</p>

<p>Conceive, if you can, the notions of equity prevailing
in a tribunal which needed to have it decreed that
fines were to be governed by the offence committed,
and not by the court’s need of money at the time!</p>

<p>Similarly illumining is Article VI, which sets forth
that imprisonment or other corporal penances must not
be commuted to fines, and that only the inquisitors-general
shall have power to dispense an offender from
wearing the <i>sanbenito</i> and to rehabilitate the children
of heretics so that they shall have liberty in the matters
of apparel and employment.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">388</span></p>

<p>As Llorente points out,<a id="FNanchor_264" href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">264</a> the very existence of this
decree shows of what abuses of power the inquisitors
were guilty for the purpose of increasing their already
considerable profit.</p>

<p>Article VII is thoroughly imbued with the inquisitorial
spirit of mercilessness. It warns inquisitors to be
cautious in the matter of admitting to reconciliation
those who confess their fault after arrest, since, considering
how many years have passed since the
institution of the Inquisition, the contumacy of such
offenders may be taken as established.</p>

<p>On the subject of Article VIII, which enjoins inquisitors
to punish false witnesses with public pains,
Llorente is particularly interesting in a commentary:</p>

<p>“Properly to understand this article, it is necessary
to realize that there were two ways of being a false
witness: one by calumniating, another by denying
knowledge of heretical words or deeds upon which a
person might be questioned in the course of proceedings
against an accused. I have seen many records of
proceedings against those of this second class, but
very rarely (<i>rarissima vez</i>) any against those of the
first. Nor could it be easy to prove that a calumniator
has borne false witness, for the unfortunate accused
would have to guess his identity, and though he were
to guess correctly the court would not admit it.”<a id="FNanchor_265" href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">265</a></p>

<p>Article IX provides that in no tribunal shall there
be two persons who are related or one who is the
servant of another, even though their respective offices
should be entirely different and separate.</p>

<p>Articles X, XI, and XVI are calculated to increase
the secrecy of inquisitorial proceedings. The first
makes provision for the secret custody of all documents
and for punishing any notary who shall betray
his trust; the second enacts that a notary must not
receive the depositions of witnesses save in the presence
of the inquisitor; the last decrees that after the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">389</span>
witnesses shall have been sworn by the inquisitors in
the presence of the fiscal, the latter must withdraw so
as not to be present when the delations are made.</p>

<p>The remaining four articles are concerned with
such matters as the setting up of courts of the
Inquisition where these have not yet been established,
the submission of difficult questions that may
arise to the Suprema for decision, the provision of
separate prisons for women and for men, and the
stipulation that officers of the court shall work six
hours daily.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In addition to the foregoing sixteen articles, he
promulgated in that same year special instructions
concerning the <i>personnel</i> of the Holy Office. They
speak for themselves, and very vividly suggest the
abuses they were framed to suppress.</p>

<p>For governors of prisons and constables he decreed
that they must permit no one to visit the prisoners
with the exception of the persons appointed to bear
them food, and that these must be bound by oath to
preserve the “secrecy” inviolate, and to examine all
food to ascertain that no written matter is concealed
in it. Food, it is added, shall be conveyed to the
prisoners by persons specially appointed for that duty,
and never by a constable or gaoler.</p>

<p>All officers are to be sworn to preserve inviolate
secrecy upon all things they may see or hear.</p>

<p>Receivers are commanded that in the event of the
acquittal of a person whose property has been sequestered,
they must restore the property according to the
inventory drawn up at the time of effecting the
sequestration&mdash;but if there are debts to be satisfied
by such a person, these may be paid by order of the
inquisitors without awaiting the consent of the debtor.</p>

<p>If amongst confiscated property there should be
any that is in litigation, the matter is to be judicially
decided; and if it is found that any property which
should have formed part of a confiscation shall have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">390</span>
passed into the hands of third parties, action is to be
taken to recover it.</p>

<p>Confiscated property is to be sold after thirty days,
and the receivers are not to purchase any under pain
of greater excommunication and a fine of 100 ducats.
Each receiver is authorized to give vouchers for property
up to the value of 300,000 maravedis.</p>

<p>For the inquisitors themselves it is provided that
upon assuming office they shall be bound by oath
to discharge their duties well and faithfully and to
observe the secrecy; that no inquisitor or officer of
the Inquisition shall receive any gift of whatsoever
nature from a prisoner, under pain of loss of office and
a fine of twice the value of the gift plus 100,000
maravedis, whilst any who shall have knowledge of
such matter and fail to divulge it shall be subject to
the same penalty.</p>

<p>Inquisitors are to make oath never to be alone with
a prisoner, and neither an inquisitor nor any officer of
the court shall hold two offices or receive two salaries.
Lastly, in any district where the Inquisition’s tribunal
is established, the inquisitors must pay for their own
lodgings, and must never receive any hospitality from
<i>conversos</i>.<a id="FNanchor_266" href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">266</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We have seen Torquemada’s efforts strained to
obtain the fullest possible control over subjects of
inquisitorial jurisdiction in Spain, and to establish
himself the sole arbiter in matters concerning heresies
there committed. And we have seen his frequent
conflicts with Rome in consequence of what he
accounted undue interference on the part of the Holy
See in affairs which he considered purely within his
own province. Despite repeated protests which had
resulted in the annulment of absolutions granted by
the Apostolic Court, the Holy See had ever continued
to receive those who fled thither from Spain in quest
of a reconciliation that was procurable in Rome upon
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">391</span>
terms far easier than were accorded by Torquemada’s
delegates.</p>

<p>Never, however, had the fugitives to Rome been
so numerous as they were now in the reign of
Alexander VI. Never before had so many Judaizers&mdash;who
were liable, if discovered in Spain, to perpetual
prison or the fire&mdash;sought at the hands of the Pontiff
the absolution which, subject to penitence and penance,
the Holy Father was willing and ready to accord
them.</p>

<p>On July 29, 1498, an Auto de F&eacute; was held in
Rome in the vast square before St. Peter’s, when
180 Spanish Judaizers came to be reconciled to the
Church.<a id="FNanchor_267" href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">267</a></p>

<p>It is worth while to take a glance at this, and to
mark the difference between the Act of Faith in the
very heart of Christendom, and the spectacles provided
under the same title by Spanish bigotry and
fanaticism.</p>

<p>There were present the Governor of Rome, Juan
de Cartagena, the Spanish Orator at the Vatican, the
Apostolic auditors, and the Master of the Sacred
Palace, whilst the Pope himself surveyed the scene
from the balcony above the steps of St. Peter’s.</p>

<p>The penitents received the <i>sanbenitos</i>, which were
put on over their ordinary garments, and arrayed in
these they entered St. Peter’s. There all were assembled
and reconciled, whereafter they were taken in procession
to the Church of Santa Maria della Minerva.
In this temple they put off their <i>sanbenitos</i>, and each
one withdrew to his home without further bearing the
insignia of shame and infamy.<a id="FNanchor_268" href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">268</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">392</span></p>

<p>The view taken by Torquemada of a Pope who so
little understood what the former considered to be the
duties of Christ’s earthly Vicar is to be gathered from
the attitude of the Sovereigns in the matter of these
reconciliations, and their protests&mdash;protests which,
beyond doubt, would be inspired by the Grand
Inquisitor.</p>

<p>Alexander advised the Sovereigns in reply&mdash;by a
brief of October 5&mdash;that in according these absolutions
one of the pains imposed upon the penanced was that
they must never return to Spain without the special
sanction of the Catholic Sovereigns.<a id="FNanchor_269" href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">269</a></p>

<p>In this manner, clearly, there was no infringement
by the Pontiff of the power relegated to the Spanish
inquisitors, since as long as the penitents remained
abroad they were beyond the jurisdiction of the Holy
Office of Spain. As for the prohibition to return being
a part of the penance imposed, it was surely supererogative,
for we cannot think that any of those who
had so fortunately obtained absolution would easily
incur the risk of coming within reach of the talons
of a court that would disregard, or else find a way
to cancel or circumvent, the Roman reconciliation.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But by the time the brief reached Spain, Frey
Tom&aacute;s de Torquemada, the arch-enemy of the Jews,
had breathed his last in his beautiful monastery of
St. Thomas at Avila.</p>

<p>He passed away in peace, laying down the burden
of life and sinking to sleep with the relief and thankfulness
of the husbandman at the end of a day of
diligent, arduous, and conscientious toil. His honesty
of purpose, his integrity, his utter devotion to the task
he had taken up are to be weighed in the balance of
historic judgment against the evil that he wrought
so ardently in the unfaltering conviction that his work
was good.</p>

<p>His name has been execrated and revered at once.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">393</span>
He has been vituperated as a fiend of cruelty, and all
but worshipped as a saint; and there is bias in both
judgments&mdash;both are no better than gratifications of
prejudice.</p>

<p>Perhaps Prescott is nearest the truth when he
says that “Torquemada’s zeal was of so extraordinary
a character that it may almost shelter itself under the
name of insanity.”<a id="FNanchor_270" href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">270</a></p>

<p>Garcia Rodrigo speaks of the barbarians of the
nineteenth century who desecrated the monastery of
St. Thomas, and whose “revolutionary hammers”
smashed so many of the sepulchral and other marbles.
He turns the medal about for us when he pours
his fierce invective upon anti-religious fanaticism
and speaks of these broken marbles as evidences
of “perversity, intolerance, and want of enlightenment.”<a id="FNanchor_271" href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">271</a></p>

<p>The anti-religious fanaticism and intolerance must
be admitted. But it must be admitted that they are
the inevitable fruits that fanaticism and intolerance
produce. Men reap as they sow. And what but
thistles shall be yielded by the seed of thistles?</p>

<p>The same author inveighs against the political
fanaticism of Spanish Liberalism, which in the hour
of reaction sought fiercely for the bones of the first
Grand Inquisitor. He denounces it indignantly for
disturbing the peace of sepulture. In the main we
share his feelings; and yet can we avoid perceiving
here a measure of retributive justice? Can we fail to
see in this fanatical act the vengeance of humanity for
the almost obscene violation of a thousand graves by
that same Grand Inquisitor’s fanaticism?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">394</span></p>

<p>He was laid to rest in the chapel of his monastery,
and his tomb bore the following simple inscription:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">HIC JACET REVERENDUS P. F. THOMAS DE TURRE-CREMATA<br /></span>
<span class="i0">PRIOR SANCT&AElig; CRUCIS, INQUISITOR GENERALIS<br /></span>

</div></div>
</div>

<p>But his work survived him. His spirit&mdash;through
his enactments&mdash;continued for three centuries after his
death to be the guiding spirit of the Inquisition,
executor of the stern testament he left inscribed upon
the walls of his monastery&mdash;</p>

 Possibly the images of the Saviour prevalent in the third century
may have contributed to the apparent fitness of this. For at this epoch&mdash;and
for some three hundred years after&mdash;these images embodied the
Greek ideas of divinity; they represented Christ as a youth of superb
grace and beauty, and they appear largely to have been founded upon
the conceptions of Orpheus. Indeed, in one representation which has
survived, we see Him as a beardless adolescent, seated upon a mountain,
grasping an instrument with whose music he has charmed the wild
beasts assembled below. Another picture in the catacombs (included in
the illustrations of Didron’s “Iconographie Chr&eacute;tienne”), representing Him
as the Good Shepherd, depicts a vigorous youth, beardless and with short
hair, in a tunic descending to the knees; His left hand supporting a lamb
which is placed across His shoulders, His right holding a shepherd’s pipe.
</p>
<p>
That such pictures were not accepted as portraits by the fathers,
but merely as idealistic representations, is clear from the disputes which
arose in the second century (and were still alive in the eighteenth)
on the subject of Christ’s personal appearance. St. Justin argued that to
render His sacrifice more touching He must have put on the most
abject of human shapes; and St. Cyril, also holding this view, uncompromisingly
pronounced Him “the ugliest of the sons of men.” But others,
imbued with the old Greek notions that beauty was in itself a mark of
divinity, protested: “If He is not beautiful, then He is not God.”
</p>
<p>
St. Augustine formally states that no knowledge existed in his day
(the fourth century) of the features of either the Saviour or His Mother.
“Nam et ipsius Dominic&aelig; facies carnis, innumerabilium cogitationum
diversitate variatur et fingitur, qu&aelig; tamen una erat, qu&aelig;cumque erat....
Neque enim novimus faciem Virginis Mari&aelig;. Nec novimus omnino, nec
credimus” (“De Trinitate,” lib. viii. cap. 4).
</p>
<p>
It is clear, therefore, that the two miraculous portraits were not known
in St. Augustine’s time&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> the Veronica, or the Holy Face (which is
preserved at St. Peter’s, Rome), and another portrait of similar origin,
which it was alleged Christ had, Himself, impressed upon a cloth and
sent to Abgarus, Prince of Edessa (as related by St. John of Damascus,
in the eighth century). To preserve it, Abgarus glued the cloth upon
wood, and thus it came later to Constantinople and thence to Rome,
where it is still believed to be treasured in the Church of St. Sylvester in
Capite.
</p>
<p>
These portraits, and still more a letter purporting to have been
written to the Roman Senate by Lentulus (who was pro-consul in Judea
before Herod) and believed to have been forged to combat the generally
repugnant theory that Christ was ugly and deformed (“sine decore et
specie”), supply the materials for the representations with which we are
to-day familiar. That letter contained the following description:
</p>
<p>
“At this time there appeared a man who is still living and who is gifted
with great power. His name is Jesus Christ. His disciples call him the
Son of God; others consider him a mighty prophet.... He is tall of
stature and his countenance is severe and full of power, so that to look
upon him is to love and to fear him. The hair of his head is of the
colour of wine; as far as the roots of the ears it is dull and straight, but
from the ears to the shoulders it is curled and glossy; from the shoulders
it falls over the back, divided into two parts, after the manner of the
Nazarenes. His brow is pure and level; his countenance is without
blemish and delicately tinted; his expression is gentle and gracious; his
nose and mouth are of perfect beauty; his beard is copious, of the colour
of his hair, and forked. His eyes are blue and extremely bright. His
face is of marvellous grace and majesty. None has ever seen him laugh,
but rather weeping. Erect of body, he has long, straight hands and
beautiful arms. In speech he is grave and weighty, and sparing of words.
He is the most beautiful of the sons of men (Pulcherrimus vultu inter
homines satos).”
</p>
<p>
It is clear, however, that there was no knowledge either of this description
or of the miraculous portraits mentioned as late as the fourth
and fifth centuries, during which Christ continued to be represented as the
lithe, beardless adolescent. And it is no doubt by these representations
that Michelangelo was inspired to present Christ in “The Last Judgment”
in a manner so unusual and startling to modern eyes.
</p>
<p>
Similarly there were no portraits of the Virgin Mary, and it is fairly
established that none came into existence until after the Council of
Ephesus, and that some seven pictures attributed to St. Luke&mdash;four of
which are in Rome&mdash;are the work of an eleventh-century Florentine
painter named Luca.
</p>
<p>
Whilst on the subject it may be added that the crucifix, as the emblem
of Christianity, was not introduced until the seventh century, when it was
established by the Quinisexte Council at Constantinople. Its nature
rendered its earlier adoption dangerous, if not impossible; since&mdash;as the
familiar Roman gallows&mdash;it was liable to provoke the scorn and derision
of the people.

 The decretal of Siricius, five years after the execution of Priscillian,
strictly enjoined celibacy on all in holy orders above the rank of a sub-deacon,
and dissolved all marriages of the clergy existing at the time.
Leo the Great, in the middle of the fifth century, further extended the
rule so as to include the sub-deacons hitherto excepted. This was
largely the cause of the split that occurred between the Greek and Latin
Churches.</p></div>

 Tom&aacute;s Tamayo de Vargas maintains that the Jews in Toledo at the
time of the Crucifixion sent a letter of warning and disapproval to their
brethren in Jerusalem. This letter&mdash;which it is alleged was translated
into Castilian when Toledo fell into the hands of Alfonso VI&mdash;the historian
quotes. Amador de los Rios, in his able and exhaustive history
of the Jews in Spain, pronounces the document to have been manufactured
to impose upon the credulity of the ignorant, since to any one
acquainted with the growth and development of the Castilian language
a glance is sufficient to prove its apocryphal character.
</p>
<p>
It is in this letter that the legend of the Jewish incursion into Spain
after the fall of Babylon has its roots. It concludes with the following
statement: “... You know that it is certain your temple must soon be
destroyed, for which reason our forefathers, upon issuing from the
Babylonian captivity, would not return to Jerusalem, but with Pyrrhus
for their captain&mdash;sent by Cyrus, who gave them many riches taken from
Babylon in the year 69 of the captivity&mdash;they came to Toledo and built
here a great aljama.”</p></div>

 In “Claros Varones de Espa&ntilde;a,” Pulgar says that even in the veins
of her sometime confessor, Frey Juan de Torquemada, Cardinal of San
Sisto, there was a strain of Jewish blood. But the authority is insufficient,
and Pulgar, himself a New-Christian, is perhaps anxious to include as
many illustrious men of his day as possible in the New-Christian ranks.
Zurita, on the other hand, says that the Cardinal’s nephew, Fr. Thomas
de Torquemada, the Grand Inquisitor, was of “clean blood”&mdash;de limpia
linaje (lib. xx. cap. xlix.). The term “clean” in this connection arose out
of the popular conception that the blood of a Jew was a dark-hued fluid,
distinguishable from the bright red blood of the Christian.</p></div>

Amador de los Rios adds in a foot-note, on the score of this girl:
“Don Reginaldo Rubino, Bishop of Tiberiades, informed of the delation
and of the state of la Fermosa Fembra, contrived that she should enter one
of the convents of the city to take the veil. But dominated by her sensual
passions, she quitted the convent without professing, and bore several
children. Her beauty having been dissipated by age, want overtook the
unnatural daughter of the millionaire Diego de Susan, and in the end she
died under the protection of a grocer. In her will she disposed that her
skull should be placed over the doorway of the house in which she had
pursued her evil life as an example and in punishment of her sins. This
house is situated in the Calle de Ata&uacute;d, opposite to its entrance from the
direction of the Alcazar, and there the skull of la Fermosa Fembra has
continued until our own times.”</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_66" href="#FNanchor_66" class="label">66</a>
 Llorente says “January 6,” an obvious mistake considering that the
inquisitors published their first edict on the 2nd of that month, and that
Susan’s offence was subsequent to that publication.</p></div>

 This, however, is a statement in which a misconception seems
obvious. If the statues were of plaster (and it is Llorente himself who
says so) they would not have stood the heat of furnaces placed beneath
them. Moreover, since death in such ovens would have been more
lingering and painful than at the stake, it is difficult to think upon what
possible grounds, where all were equally guilty, any of the condemned
should have been relegated to this further degree of torment, or&mdash;conversely&mdash;those
who died at the stake should have been spared it. Besides,
it is to be remembered that it was desired, and held desirable, that the
victims should suffer in full view of the faithful. But the mistake which
has crept in can be indicated. What Bernaldez actually says is: “Ficieron
facer aquel quemadero en Tablado con aquellos quatro profetas de yeso
en que los quemaban.” The “en que” may refer either to the Quemadero
generally or to the statues in particular. But there can be little doubt
that it refers to the Quemadero, and that Llorente was mistaken in
assuming it to refer to the statues.
</p>
<p>
A curious instance of adapting the shape of a fact so that it will fit
the idea to be conveyed is afforded in this connection by Dr. Rule, who
calmly alters the substance of the statues, translating <i>yeso</i> as “limestone.”

 Garcia Rodrigo tells us that the architect of this elaborate altar of
intolerance was a New-Christian of such zeal that he found employment
in the Holy Office as one of its receivers, but that being discovered in
Judaizing practices he was himself burnt on the Quemadero he had
erected. No authority is furnished for the story, nor does Llorante
mention it, and one is inclined to place it in the category of fables such
as that which relates how the first head to be shorn off by the guillotine
was that of its inventor, Dr. Guillotin.</p></div>

It is interesting to turn to modern writers who defend this secrecy&mdash;such,
for instance, as the Rev. Sidney Smith, S.J., whose good faith there
is no cause to doubt. He writes as follows: “To pass over the question
of injury often done to the reputation of third parties, it has occasionally
been forced on public attention that crimes cannot be put down because
witnesses know that by giving evidence they expose themselves to great
risks, the accused having powerful friends to execute vengeance in their
behalf. This was exactly the case with the Inquisition. The Marranos
had great power through their wealth, position, and secret bonds of alliance
with the unconverted Jews. These would certainly have endeavoured to
neutralize the efforts of the Holy Office had the trials been open. Torquemada,
in his statutes of 1484, gives expressly this defence of secrecy, etc.”&mdash;“The
Spanish Inquisition,” p 17, in “Historical Papers.”
</p>
<p>
The argument is specious, and it is fundamentally true. But when it
is considered that the delator, so carefully screened from all danger, was
protected entirely at the expense of the accused, it becomes clear that such
a procedure must argue a reckless eagerness to accumulate convictions.
It suffices to reflect that, whilst all the arguments advanced to justify this
secrecy could with equal justice have been urged by the contemporary
civil courts of Europe, it is impossible to point to a single one that had
recourse to so inequitable a measure. The inquisitorial point of view may
be appreciated, even with a certain sympathy, by the extremely tolerant.
It cannot be justified.</p></div>

Llorente estimates the number of Torquemada’s victims at 8,800 burnt,
6,500 burnt in effigy, and 90,000 penanced in various degrees. These
figures, however, are unreliable and undoubtedly exaggerated, although
they are in themselves a correction of his earlier estimate, which fixes the
number of burnt at upwards of 10,000&mdash;an estimate flagrantly preferred by
Dr. Rule and other partisan writers on the subject.</p></div>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
